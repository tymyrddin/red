Red Team
=======================================

The red team is a group roleplaying the most likely adversaries to attack the organisational assets, by
pentesting and social engineering attacks to validate whether there is enough protection on the organisational assets.

If an organisation has cycled through enough pentests and feels confident, red teaming can be a multi-layered attack
simulation to measure how well people and networks, applications, and physical security controls can withstand an attack
from a real-life adversary.

To start off in the red team as someone without hacking experience, we recommend following a story of a small grove
in the forest first. It does contain hacks that can only happen in a lab context, and is meant to give an impression of
the choreography of a systematic hack.
