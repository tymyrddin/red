Red Team
=======================================

The digital forest is wild, unpredictable, and full of surprises. As red teamers, we don’t just walk the beaten path;
we bushwhack through firewalls, ford rivers of misconfigurations, and occasionally trip over a root (account).

We walk through the untamed cyber-forest—a sprawling, overgrown landscape shaped by decades of humanoid tinkering,
half-baked patches, and the occasional "it’s fine, nobody would ever try that" mentality. Here, the vines are made of
spaghetti code, the swamps are logging pits of debug errors, and the crown jewels are always hidden in the last place
you’d expect.

We navigate this ecosystem with the grace of a fox, the persistence of a raccoon in a dumpster, and the sheer audacity
of a squirrel who’s convinced the bird feeder definitely belongs to them. These are our tales of triumph, failure,
and the occasional "wait, that actually worked?" moments—all served with a side of snark.
