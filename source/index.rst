Red Team
=======================================

The forest is huge and wild, a digital landscape formed by nature's own processes and humanoid
activities and neglect throughout decades.

Red teaming is like pentesting, in a way, but the red team is not systematically looking to find every single
vulnerability or weakness in a particular scope. The team is trying to infiltrate like a real attacker would,
by any means necessary. The goal is to find the most effective way into an organisation or system.
