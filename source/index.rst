Red Team
=======================================

The red team simulates the TTP's of a most likely adversary and tries to get at the crown jewels
(usually a flag).

These are writeups made from our adventures in the forest, huge and wild, a digital landscape formed by nature's own
processes and humanoid activities and neglect throughout decades.
