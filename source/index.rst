Red Team
=======================================

Initially, the red team can be a group roleplaying the most likely adversaries to attack an organisational asset or
assets to validate whether there is enough protection on those organisational asset(s).

If an organisation has cycled through enough pentests and feels confident, red teaming can be a multi-layered attack
simulation to measure how well people and networks, applications, and physical security controls can withstand an attack
from a real-life adversary.

Grove
---------------------------------------

To start off in a red team as someone without hacking experience, we recommend following a story of a small grove
in the forest first. It does contain a few hacks that can only happen in a lab context (new AV security controls make
these Windows hacks impossible, unless you are working on very old targets), but most of these attacks still work, and
the grove is useful as an impression of the choreography of a systematic hack, and to wet appetites for more.

Forest
---------------------------------------

The forest is huge and wild, a digital landscape formed by nature's own processes and humanoid
activities and neglect throughout decades. People social engineer other people for profit, power and
status. Social engineeringing can also be used for other, less harmful purposes, like the development of
healthy security cultures.
