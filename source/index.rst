Red Teaming
=======================================

Red teaming is a full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation, in the forest. It is meant to measure how well people
and networks, applications, and physical security controls can withstand an attack from a real-life adversary.

To start off in the red team as someone without hacking experience, we recommend following a story of a small grove
in the forest first.
