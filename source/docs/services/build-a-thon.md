# Build-a-thon: Red team IaC

A hands-on, collaborative workshop where participants design, build, and deploy red team infrastructure using code.

## What is it?

The Build-a-thon is a collaborative session where teams design and implement red team infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. Participants work through exercises to automate and manage infrastructure in a controlled lab environment, using European cloud providers such as Hetzner.

## Why it matters

Red team infrastructure is essential for offensive security operations. Using IaC ensures consistency, reproducibility, and efficiency in deployment. This workshop teaches participants how to plan, implement, and maintain infrastructure for testing and simulations.

## Workshop flow (what participants do)

| Session              | Activity                                                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Introduction         | Overview of IaC principles, tools, and workshop goals.                    |
| Planning & Design    | Teams design their red team infrastructure architecture.                  |
| Implementation       | Hands-on coding session to build the infrastructure in a lab environment. |
