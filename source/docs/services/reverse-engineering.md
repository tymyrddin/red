# Reverse-engineering starter clinic

A one-day workshop where curiosity meets code—learn to peel back the layers of software to see how it really works.

## What is it?

In the Red part of the forest, Through is about exploring the inside of binaries—programs and executables—without breaking anything. Reverse-engineering here is about understanding what a program actually does, rather than trusting what the documentation claims. Participants work hands-on with small sample binaries in a safe lab environment, learning to spot patterns, extract information, and see the structure of code.


## Why it matters

Attackers reverse-engineer software to uncover hidden functionality, weaknesses, or secrets. Defenders can do the same to assess risk and understand potential threats. This starter clinic makes these skills accessible: you do not need deep assembly knowledge to start discovering what binaries reveal.

| Binary forage (Morning)               | Learn basic tools and safe lab setup for binary exploration. Disassemble a small sample program.  | [Foraging for secrets in binaries](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/through/reverse-engineering/)                                                                                               |
| Patterns and puzzles (Midday)         | Explore control flow, strings, and data structures. Identify what looks suspicious or unexpected. | [Reverse engineering training grounds](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/through/reverse-engineering/grounds/)                                                                                   |
| Through the looking-glass (Afternoon) | Teams work on a simple unknown binary, document its behaviour, and present findings.              | [Windows binaries](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/through/reverse-engineering/cracking/windows) / [Linux binaries](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/through/reverse-engineering/cracking/linux) |


## What you’ll walk away with

* Practical understanding of reverse-engineering fundamentals.
* A step-by-step method for exploring binaries safely.
* Confidence to apply these techniques in your own organisation.
* A short “behavioural sketch” of a sample binary to take home.

## Who is this for?

* Security teams and analysts who want hands-on experience.
* Curious technical staff looking to understand how attackers analyse software.
* Non-technical staff who want to appreciate what reverse-engineering reveals about risk.

## Delivery at a glance

* Duration: Full-day, divided into morning, midday, and afternoon sessions with hands-on labs and group exercises.
* Setup: Safe local lab environment; no cloud required. Participants can use desktops or laptops with prepared binaries and pre-installed tools.
* Why it works: Participants practise real exploratory techniques in a narrative, engaging format—no jargon, no pressure, just guided discovery.
