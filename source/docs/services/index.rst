Myrddin's menagerie
======================================================

  :alt: A wild forest with foxes, raccoons, squirrels, and falcons, interacting with glowing digital artefacts, signal flares, hidden traps, and networked trees.

In the Red Wilds, messages scurry like nervous squirrels and signals flare like foxfire across the
trees. Here, cunning, curiosity, and craft converge: workshops and hands-on exercises to map,
probe, and disrupt adversary rhythms. Learn to see through the forest, follow the twitch of a
tail or the glint of a scanner, and protect your treasures before the danger reaches them.
