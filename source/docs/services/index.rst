Ty Myrddin services
======================================================

Welcome to Ty Myrddin services in the Red wilds—where cunning, curiosity, and hands-on craft meet the untidy
reality of digital forests. Here, workshops and facilitated processes let you explore the behaviours, tradecraft,
and tricks of determined adversaries: spotting, moving, and protecting valuable assets with the instincts of foxes,
raccoons, and squirrels. From mapping what outsiders can see, to reverse engineering binaries, to building your own
attacker infrastructure, these sessions are about understanding and disrupting adversary rhythms—without pretending
the terrain is neat or the rules are followed.
