Myrddin's Menagerie
======================================================

Welcome to Myrddin's Menagerie. In the Red Wilds of the digital forest, where reality is untidy, we bring together
cunning, curiosity, and hands-on craft. This is a collection of workshops and facilitated processes designed
support exploring the behaviours, tradecraft, and tricks of determined adversaries. Spot, move, and protect valuable
assets with the instincts of foxes, raccoons, and squirrels. From mapping external visibility to reverse engineering
binaries and building attacker infrastructure, the sessions focus on understanding and disrupting adversary
rhythmsâ€”because the terrain is never neat and the rules are never followed.
