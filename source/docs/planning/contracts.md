# Contracts and agreements

Usually signed before scoping.

* A service-level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider
and the customer as to the expected level of service that should be received.
The level of service could be measured in bandwidth, uptime, or quality of
service expected.
* A confidentiality agreement is an agreement to keep details
private between the two parties. The confidentiality agreement identifies
information that should be kept private to the two parties involved and for how
long the information is to be kept private. As it relates to penetration testing,
the customer may have the pentester sign a confidentiality agreement that
indicates the pentester is not to disclose information about the customerâ€™s
environment and the results of the penetration test to anyone. A confidentiality
agreement is also known as a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).
* A statement of work (SOW) is a contract created by the penetration
testing company that specifies the type of work its pentesters are providing,
the timeline for performing the work, the cost of the work, the payment
schedule, and any terms and conditions covering the work.
* A master service agreement (MSA) is a useful contract if you are
performing repeat work for a company. The MSA acts as a standard boiler
plate contract for the business relationship between the contractor and
customer saving time when repeat work is needed from the contractor. With
the MSA, you can define the terms of the work in the MSA and then refer to
that from the SOW for each reoccurring engagement. Examples of terms in
the MSA include payment terms, working conditions, remediation processes,
and ownership of intellectual property.
* A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a common document outlining the
importance of confidentiality in regard to the relationship of the two parties
and the work performed. It identifies what information should be kept
confidential and how confidential information should be handled. The NDA is
created by the customer and given to the contractor to sign. The NDA is
designed to protect the confidentiality of sensitive information that the
contractor may come across while doing the penetration test.
