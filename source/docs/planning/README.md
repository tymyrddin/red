# Introduction

## What?

Planning and scoping is a necessary and critical phase of the pentesting process.

## Why?

* Not planning the penetration test properly can result in crashing the customerâ€™s systems or network 
(causing loss in production and revenue) and triggering intrusion detection systems. 
* A lack of planning can also create legal problems due to a failure to obtain proper authorisation to perform the 
penetration test.

## How?

* [Contracts and agreements](contracts.md)
* [Disclaimers](disclaimers.md)
* [Scoping](scoping.md)
* [Rules of engagement](roe.md)
* [Targets for the pentesting](targets.md)
* [Scheduling and scope creep](scheduling.md)
