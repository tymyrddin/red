Understanding what we're attempting to secure sounds obvious, yet organisations routinely skip this step and proceed
directly to installing firewalls around systems they do not understand, protecting assets they have not identified,
and defending against threats not considered. Rather like Vetinari attempting to secure Ankh-Morpork without first
understanding that the Thieves' Guild considers theft a legitimate profession, or that the Seamstresses' Guild isn't
actually about sewing.

It is probably more complicated than we think, contains more legacy systems than anyone admits, and is most likely
held together with configurations someone implemented in 2003 and nobody dared change because "it works."
