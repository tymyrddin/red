Reporting and remediation
======================================================

Prioritising remediation and implementing fixes in this environment is a game of timing, diplomacy, and occasionally
gentle coercion. Some systems can be patched immediately, others must wait until the summer break or a Bursar-free
window. Quick wins are balanced against critical fixes, and compensating controls are introduced where patching is
impossible without triggering unexpected alchemical side effects.

Throughout, change management, testing, and staff training ensure that fixes improve security without breaking
production, and tabletop exercises help everyone understand the consequences before anything goes bang.
