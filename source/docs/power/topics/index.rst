In OT environments, the devil is always in the details. Tackling some of the trickier stuff where remote access, safety
systems, and supply chains collide with security. Wireless and remote testing is about spotting hidden connections
(rogue 4G routers, misbehaving Bluetooth) without tripping the machines that keep the city lights on.

The trick? Observe, verify, and prove the risk without ever causing a hiccup. Whether it is checking shutdown logic without touching a
button, or poking at third-party updates, the aim is to show danger exists, but gently.
