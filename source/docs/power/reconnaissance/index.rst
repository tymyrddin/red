Reconnaissance
======================================================

In Ankh-Morpork terms, reconnaissance is what the Thieves' Guild does before a job: watching the building, noting
the guard changes, identifying the exits, and crucially, checking whether the Assassins' Guild has already claimed
the contract.

We can adopt and adapt their insights: The goal is to map the visible infrastructure, identify potential
entry points, and understand the technology stack, without triggering any alarms or leaving traces. When done
properly, reconnaissance is invisible. The target never knows you were looking, which is rather the point.
