Exploitation and impact demonstration
======================================================

The Patrician has a particular skill for making people understand consequences without actually having to demonstrate
them. A meaningful glance at the window, a thoughtful comment about the drop, and perhaps a casual mention of
terminal velocity is usually sufficient. The art lies in making the consequence feel real without making it actually
real, which is considerably harder than it sounds but infinitely preferable to the alternative.

This is essentially what exploitation and impact demonstration in OT penetration testing requires. We must prove
that terrible things are possible without actually doing terrible things. We need to demonstrate sufficient technical
evidence that stakeholders believe us, take action, and allocate budget for remediation.

The challenge is finding that precise balance between "this is theoretically possible but I can not prove it" (which
nobody takes seriously) and "I have just caused a safety incident and there are people wearing fluorescent vests
running in multiple directions" (which everyone takes seriously but also gets us arrested).
