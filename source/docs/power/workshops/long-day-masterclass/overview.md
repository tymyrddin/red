# A Day in Ankh-Morpork: The UU Power & Light Security Adventure

*Learn pentesting by living it - a full-day roleplay for university students*

## What is this?

A full-day security adventure where you learn pentesting by playing roles in a realistic scenario. You're not sitting through lectures. You're red team hackers, security defenders, operations engineers, and university bureaucrats all trying to secure (or compromise) Unseen University's power plant.

Duration: Full day (6-8 hours, flexible, self-paced)

For: University students learning cybersecurity, no OT experience needed

Style: Roleplay, hands-on, fun, experiential - learn by doing and playing

## What you'll do

- Play a role: Red team pentester, blue team defender, operations engineer, or university leadership
- Use real tools: Hack actual control systems using the UU P&L simulator
- Attack or defend: Depending on your role, you'll exploit vulnerabilities or try to stop attacks
- Negotiate and argue: Red team wants to shut everything down for security. Operations wants to keep the lights on. Fight it out!
- Present to the Patrician: Convince Lord Vetinari that your recommendations matter to Ankh-Morpork
- Learn pentesting: Industrial protocols, reconnaissance, exploitation, reporting - by actually doing it

## Why it's fun

- You're hackers breaking into a power plant (legally)
- You can actually crash turbines and watch things break (in the simulator)
- You'll argue with operations people who hate all your ideas
- The Patrician will ask you questions you can't answer
- You'll discover that the technical stuff is easy - convincing people is hard
- Discworld setting makes everything more entertaining

## What you'll learn

Technical skills:
- Industrial protocol pentesting (Modbus, S7, OPC UA, EtherNet/IP)
- Network reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery
- Proof of concept exploitation
- Attack scenario development

Professional skills:
- Security report writing
- Stakeholder presentations
- Handling pushback and difficult questions
- Prioritising fixes when you can't fix everything
- Working across teams with different goals

Strategic skills:
- Understanding business context
- Risk-based decision-making
- Balancing security vs operations
- Thinking like different stakeholders

## How it works

Morning: Red team does pentesting while others prepare
Lunch: Everyone shares findings and context
Afternoon: Prioritise fixes, plan remediation, present to stakeholders
End: Defend your recommendations to the Patrician, negotiate final decisions

But it's flexible - if you're having fun hacking, keep hacking. If you want to dive deep into one attack, go for it. Learn at your own pace.

## Who you'll be

Red team (4-5 students): Attack everything, create spectacular proof of concepts, write the scary report

Blue team (2-3 students): Defend the network, figure out how to fix things, work with operations

Operations (2-3 students): Keep the power running, push back on changes that cause downtime, be appropriately skeptical

University leadership (2-3 students): Control the budget, ask "why should I care?", approve or reject recommendations

The Patrician (facilitator or experienced student): Ask the really hard questions, make final decisions

## What you need

- Laptop with Python 3.8+
- Willingness to roleplay and have fun
- No prior OT security experience required
- Collaborative attitude

## Ready to play?

Welcome to Ankh-Morpork. UU Power & Light needs your help. Or maybe they need protection from you.

Either way, it's going to be a long, fun day.

See the [student guide](student-guide.md) for the full roleplay scenario and how to play.
