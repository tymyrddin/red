# Tail of deception: Framing the blue jays

*"In 2025, attribution is a hall of mirrors. Your false flags should have the defenders arguing with each other."*

## False flag fundamentals 

Because nothing says "professional" like blaming someone else for your chaos.

**Objectives:**

- ✔ Blame your mess on rival APTs (e.g., make Russia look like it’s moonlighting as China)
- ✔ Maintain plausible deniability—especially helpful when you’re a government with a PR team
- ✔ Spark internal witch hunts ("Who gave Bob root access again?")
- ✔ Pour gasoline on geopolitical tensions and watch the fireworks

## False flag techniques: 2025 Edition

### Linguistic deception

Why use your native tongue when you can cosplay as a foreign intelligence agency?

**Nation-State context:**

- Add Mandarin or Cyrillic comments in malware (Google Translate is the new SIGINT)
- Change system timezone to fake origin

```powershell
# Pretend you're in Shanghai
Set-TimeZone -Id "China Standard Time"
```

**Corporate Espionage:**

Create fake employee accounts just before [exfiltrate](exfiltration.md):

```
# Totally not suspicious
New-Mailbox -Name "The Joker" -UserPrincipalName j.assange@company.com
```

### Code Borrowing & Weaponized Open Source

Nothing says “elite” like Ctrl+C from GitHub.

NGO/Small Business context:

* Clone Lazarus Group-style GitHub repos
* Sprinkle in fake foreign identifiers

```
# Hangul = Instant panic
$fakeSig = "조선민주주의인민공화국"  # DPRK in Hangul
```

Nation-state grade: Recompile tools with Iranian APT34’s digital signature—because branding matters.

### Infrastructure spoofing

Where you host matters. And Belarus is totally innocent, right?

* Rent VPSs in "attributable" countries
* Use VPNs with rival-nation exit nodes (Iranian IPs are always a hit)

### Behavioural misdirection

Why brute force when you can blame Carl from IT?

Corporate Espionage:

* Abuse ex-employee credentials (bonus points if they were fired)
* Use real IT tools (e.g., SCCM) for lateral movement

Nation-State shenanigans: Stage "hacktivist" leaks on Telegram (because Telegram = instant credibility)

## Real-World scenarios (Totally fictional, obviously)

### Framing China for financial mischief

Target: A U.S. bank that really should’ve invested more in detection.

Steps:

* Deploy ransomware with Mandarin error messages
* Route C2 through an Alibaba Cloud instance
* Drop malware with Chinese APT hallmarks

Outcome: The FBI blames the PLA. Meanwhile, the real attackers cash out in Monero and toast your confusion.

### NGO Hit with “Hacktivist” flair

Target: An environmental NGO about to get bought out.

Steps:

* Tag their site with “Anonymous Brazil” logos (graphic design is your passion)
* Leak juicy emails from a conveniently hacked ProtonMail
* Leave behind a Brazilian keyboard layout for that spicy attribution

Outcome: NGO blames Brazil. Corporate raiders sip coffee and continue the acquisition.

### Small business, big problem

Target: HVAC vendor. Real goal? Their defense contractor clients.

Steps:

* Slip malware through their RMM tool
* Sign it with stolen Korean certs
* Trigger antivirus panic with "KimJongRAT"

Outcome: Victim yells “North Korea!” to CISA. Meanwhile, your red team is already inside the contractor’s network.

## Countermeasures (OpSec testing checklist)

| Tactic	| Red Team Evasion Strategy |
| Language Analysis	| Mix CJK + Cyrillic strings for max confusion |
| Code Similarity	| Blend APT29 with APT41 samples—let analysts guess |
| Infrastructure	| Host in Bulgaria, VPN through Iran |
| Behavioural Forensics	| Mimic disgruntled insiders with real stolen creds |

*"The best false flags are 70% real—just enough to make defenders argue in Slack for two weeks."*
