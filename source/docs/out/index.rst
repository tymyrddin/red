OUT: Where squirrels swipe the crown jewels
============================================

The Out phase is where we, like hyper-entitled squirrels, decide which shiny treasures actually belong to us.
Data? Taken. Flags? Stashed. Logs? Cleared with the audacity of a rodent who just raided a bird feeder and left the
empty husks behind. This isn’t exfiltration—it’s a shopping spree, where we waltz out with the loot, scatter decoy
nuts for the blue team to chase, and vanish into the digital canopy like we were never there. After all, if you
didn’t want us to have it, why was it just lying around?
