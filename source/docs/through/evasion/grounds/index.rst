Slippery paws: Practise makes untraceable
=======================================================================

Before you vanish into the digital undergrowth, it pays to train where the traps are laid bare. These grounds are
where red teamers sharpen their stealthâ€”experimenting with bypassing antivirus, slipping past logging systems,
and becoming ghosts in sandboxed machines. Here, like a raccoon honing its knack for opening the supposedly
raccoon-proof bin, you can practise the fine art of disappearing into the logs (or better yet, never appearing at all).
