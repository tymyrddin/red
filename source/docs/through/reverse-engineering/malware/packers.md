# Packers

Malware is often packed. It produces a smaller version of the executable and more difficult to analyse. A malware 
analyst will still be able to work with a packed version for a behavioural analysis but for static analysis, an 
unpacked version may be necessary.

## Identifying packers

* Opening a packed executable with tools like OllyDbg and IDA-Pro will produce a warning that the executable may be 
packed.
* Packed programs have very few imports (usually `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`), or no import at all.
* Many packers leave text signatures inside the packed binary.
* In some cases, the `file` command will be able to identify the packer (`UPX compressed`, `PECompact2 compressed`)
* Tools like [PEiD](https://github.com/wolfram77web/app-peid) ([python version](https://github.com/packing-box/peid)) 
and [pev](https://www.kali.org/tools/pev/) detect most common packers, cryptors and compilers for PE files.
