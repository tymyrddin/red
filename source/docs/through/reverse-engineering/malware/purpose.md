# Purpose of a malware attack

A "targeted" attack is created for a specific purpose against a specific target. Examples are the 
[DarkHotel](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/darkhotel-malware-virus-threat-definition) malware, 
designed to steal information such as authentication details from government officials, and 
[Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet), the gift that kept (keeps) giving.

"Mass campaigns" are the most common type of attacks. These intend to infect as many devices as possible and perform 
whatever it may - regardless of target. An example is 
[Wannacry](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/ransomware-wannacry), a ransomware that used the 
Eternalblue exploit.

And this is where it gets blurry. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) like the 
[Crouching Yeti](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/crouching-yeti-energetic-bear-malware-threat) 
could be considered a "mass campaign" and specifically targets:

* Industrial/machinery
* Manufacturing
* Pharmaceutical
* Construction
* Education
* Information technology

In geopolitical terms, it can be considered a "targeted" attack. And because there is a rather large scope of this 
variant of malware, it can also be considered as a "mass campaign" attack.
