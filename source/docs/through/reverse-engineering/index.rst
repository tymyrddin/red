Foraging for secrets in binaries
==================================

   :alt: A dark, mysterious digital forest at night, glowing binaries scattered like hidden treasures, a cunning raccoon examining and prying open glowing code fragments, curious eyes scanning obfuscated patterns, secrets spilling like shimmering sparks, intricate circuitry woven into the forest floor.

Reverse engineering is what happens when curiosity meets stubbornness. Take apart malware, crack open binaries, and
stare long enough at obfuscated code until the secrets spill out. Think of it as digital foraging.
