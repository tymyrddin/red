# Reverse engineering in Windows

Programs in the Windows environment communicate with the system by using Windows APIs. These APIs are built around the file system, memory management (including processes, the stack, and allocations), the registry hive, network communication, and so forth. 

Being able to use Windows APIs and their library modules is an advantage when it comes to easily understanding how a program works when seen in its low-level language equivalent.
