Cracking nuts
=================================

Notes on techniques for cracking (reverse enigeering) previously made devices, processes, systems, or pieces of
software. Knowledge gained during cracking can help with repurposing obsolete objects, doing security analysis, or
learning how something works.

These notes can serve as cheatsheets and easy entry level for others. And communication with peers also just feels
nice, and improves collaborating with others and other teams.
