# ELF x86 random crackme

[Root-me challenge](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Cracking/ELF-Random-Crackme?action_solution=voir&debut_affiche_solutions=2#pagination_affiche_solutions): This crackme can be solved in many different ways. We’ll let you find them. Note that you might get errors when executing the application. This is expected :)

Compiler : GCC 4.3; Architecture: intel (x86) 32Bits

----

1. Use, for example `r2`
2. Go to `main()`.
3. Visual Mode
4. In function `0x8048da3` find address to look at.
