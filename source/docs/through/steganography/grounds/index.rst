Steganography training grounds
=================================

The Steganography training grounds are where the real magic happens. This is payloads are hidden as seamlessly as a
raccoon stashes an entire pizza behind a dumpster. Working with images, audio, and text to hide payloads in plain sight,
making sure that the only thing the defenders see is what we want them to.
