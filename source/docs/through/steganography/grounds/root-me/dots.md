# Yellow dots

[root-me challenge](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Steganography/Yellow-dots): You attend an interview for a forensic investigator job and they give you a challenge to solve as quickly as possible (having the Internet). 

They ask you to find the date of printing as well as the serial number of the printer in this document.
You remain dubitative and accept the challenge.
