RootMe steganography challenges: Finding the hidden scraps
===========================================================

The RootMe Steganography challenges are the ultimate test of your ability to spot the hidden in the obvious. Just like
a raccoon searching for leftover food, you’ll need to sniff out embedded data within seemingly innocuous files,
unraveling secrets hidden in every pixel, soundwave, and bit of code. These challenges take your skills from basic to
expert, proving that there’s always more lurking beneath the surface.
