THROUGH: Where the raccoons burrow and rummage
=================================================

The Through phase is where attackers turn from guests into squatters—rummaging through your network like a raccoon in
a midnight dumpster. Why smash doors when you can pick locks, tunnel through ducts, and loot the good stuff without
anyone noticing? We escalate privileges like raccoons scaling fences, pivot through systems like they’re overturned
trash cans, and leave every registry/keyhole/data cache thoroughly pilfered. The goal? Turn "I’m in" into
"I own the place"—one misconfigured service at a time.
