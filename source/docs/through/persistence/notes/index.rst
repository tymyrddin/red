My growing trusty handbook for leaving my digital scent wherever I go. Just like a raccoon who
remembers exactly where it stashed its last meal, this is where I gather the tips, tricks, and techniques to ensure

service backdoors, or cron jobs, these are the details that will help me keep my paws in the system without
getting caught.
