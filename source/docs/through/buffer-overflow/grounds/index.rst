Overstuffed buffers and the curious claws that find them
===========================================================

Here’s where things get messy—in the best possible way. These training grounds are dedicated to the chaotic elegance
of buffer overflows: pushing past memory limits, hijacking execution flow, and poking around where polite code
would not dare. Much like a raccoon that ignores size constraints to wedge itself into an overflowing compost heap,
force your way in, take control, and rummage through the guts of vulnerable systems.
