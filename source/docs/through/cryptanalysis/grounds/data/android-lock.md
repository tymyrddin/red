# Android lock pattern

[RootMe: System - Android lock pattern](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Cryptanalysis/System-Android-lock-pattern): Having doubts about the loyalty of your partner, youâ€™ve decided to read SMS, mail, etc. in his/her/hes smartphone. Unfortunately it is locked by schema. In spite of that, you still manage to retrieve system files.

You need to find this test scheme to unlock smartphone.

## Android lock pattern

Instead of storing a lock pattern directly, Android stores a hashed byte array in a system file called `gesture.key` located in the `/data/system` folder. 

## Solution

Download and decompress:

```text
tar -xvfj ch17.tbz2

...
```
