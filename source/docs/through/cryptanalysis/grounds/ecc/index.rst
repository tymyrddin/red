Curves ahead: Navigating elliptic curve cryptography
=======================================================

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) offers strong security with smaller keys, but it's not invincible. This section
explores the mathematics behind ECC and its potential vulnerabilities. Like a raccoon traversing winding paths,
navigate these curves with precision.
