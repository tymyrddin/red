Old tricks, new treats: Unmasking classical ciphers
======================================================

Delve into the world of classical ciphers: Caesar, Vigenère, and more. These time-tested encryptions may seem outdated,
but they still hold lessons for the modern cryptanalyst. Like a raccoon rummaging through an old attic,
discover the patterns and vulnerabilities that make these ciphers crackable.
