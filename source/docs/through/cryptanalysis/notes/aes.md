# AES busting

AES is a symmetric key, block cipher algorithm. It is used in many common Internet protocols and operating system services, including TLS, IPSec, and file-level or full-disk encryption. Given its ubiquity, it is an important cipher to know how to use, and the principles of (in)correct use of AES transfer easily to (in)correct use of other ciphers.

Even though AES is a block cipher, it (like many other block ciphers) can be used in a way that makes it behave like a stream cipher.

AES processes blocks of 128 bits using a secret key of 128, 192, or 256 bits, with the 128-bit key being the most common because it makes encryption slightly faster and because the difference between 128- and 256-bit security is meaningless for most applications.

## ECB

The most basic encryption mode is the electronic codebook (ECB) mode. The message is divided into blocks and each block is encrypted separately. The problem is that if you submit the same plain text more than once, you always get the same ciphertext. This gives attackers a place to begin analysing the cipher to attempt to derive the key. ECB is using the cipher exactly as it is described without improving its security.

There is no good reason to use ECB over CBC, if both ends of the communication can support CBC. Cipher block chaining is a strong deterrent to known plain text attacks.

## CBC

When using [cipher block chaining (CBC) mode](https://github.com/tymyrddin/scripts-modern-ciphers/tree/main/aes), each block of plaintext is XOR’d with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This means there is more randomness in the final ciphertext. This is much more secure than electronic codebook mode and is the most common mode.

![CBC Encryption](/_static/images/cbc-encryption.png)

The only issue with CBC is the first block. There is no preceding block of ciphertext to XOR the first plaintext block with. It is common to add an initial vector (IV) to the first block so that it has something to be XOR'd with. The initial vector is a pseudorandom number, much like the cipher key. Usually, an IV is only used once, a $nonce$ (Number Only used Once).

The decryption process in CBC mode is done as:

![CBC Encryption](/_static/images/cbc-decryption.png)

\begin{align} P_1 =& Dec_k(C_1) \oplus IV\\ P_i =& Dec_k(C_i) \oplus C_{i-1},\;\; 1 < i \leq nb, \end{align}

where $nb$ is the number of blocks.

### Bit-flipping attack

If you know the position of the target byte, then you can modify the corresponding ciphertext position in the previous ciphertext block. For example, if you modify a byte in the ciphertext $C_{i-1}$, then $P_i$ will be changed by one block since $C_{i-1}$ only affects the plaintext $P_i$ by $\oplus$.

![CBC Encryption](/_static/images/cbc-decryption-garbage.png)

A ciphertext byte of $C_2$ is modified: This affects the corresponding byte in the next plaintext block $P_3$ and in the corresponding full plaintext block $P_2$ which has the same index as the modified ciphertext which is garbage. There is an error.

An $\text{IV}$ byte is modified: This affects only the corresponding byte in the first plaintext $P_1$. If the target plaintext is in the first block, this will not leave a trace.

### Padding oracle attack

A padding oracle is a system that behaves differently depending on whether the padding in a CBC-encrypted ciphertext is valid. You can see it as a black box or an API that returns either a success or an error value. A padding oracle can be found in a service on a remote host sending error messages when it receives malformed ciphertexts. The preferred method of padding block ciphertexts is PKCS7. In PKSC7, the value of each padded byte is the same as the number of bytes being added.

Given a padding oracle, [padding oracle attacks](https://github.com/tymyrddin/scripts-modern-ciphers/tree/main/aes) record which inputs have a valid padding and which do not, and exploit this information to decrypt chosen ciphertext values.

Assume having intercepted a CBC encrypted ciphertext, and being able to connect with a server to pass in any ciphertext, and the server will tell us whether it decrypts to plaintext with valid padding or not. The server is used as oracle.

In CBC decryption, each ciphertext is passed through the cipher, then XORed with the previous ciphertext block to give the plaintext. The attack works by calculating the "intermediate state" of the decryption for each ciphertext. This is the state of a ciphertext block after being decrypted by the block cipher but before being XORed with the previous ciphertext block.

![CBC padding oracle attack](/_static/images/cbc-oracle-attack1.png)

$C_1$ is known already, as it is just part of the intercepted ciphertext, so if we find $I_2$ then we can trivially find $P_2$ and decrypt the ciphertext.

![CBC padding oracle attack](/_static/images/cbc-oracle-attack2.png)

1. Pick a random block $C_1$ and vary its last byte until the padding oracle accepts the ciphertext as valid. Usually, in a valid ciphertext, $C_1[15] ⊕ X[15]$ = 01, so you’ll find $X[15]$ after trying around 128 values of $C1[15]$.
2. Find the value $X[14]$ by setting $C_1[15]$ to $X[15] ⊕ 02$ and searching for the $C_1[14]$ that gives correct padding. When the oracle accepts the ciphertext as valid, it means you have found $C_1[14]$ such that $C_1[14] ⊕ X[14] = 02$.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all 16 bytes.

_In the wilderness (real digital world), implementing a padding oracle attack is a bit more complicated than that, because one has to [deal with wrong guesses at step 1](https://github.com/tymyrddin/scripts-modern-ciphers/blob/main/aes/padding_oracle_attack.py). A ciphertext may have valid padding not because $P_2$ ends with a single `01` but because it ends with two `02` bytes or three `03` bytes. But that’s easily managed by testing the validity of ciphertexts where more bytes are modified._

## CTR

In CTR mode, encryption XORs the plaintext and the stream taken from “encrypting” the nonce, `N`, and counter, `Ctr`. Decryption is the same, so you only need the encryption algorithm for both
encryption and decryption.

## Security

Never reuse key and IV pairs. Reusing a key and IV pair in CBC produces predictable output for predictable headers. Parts of the messages that you might be inclined not to think about at all, because they are boilerplate or contain hidden structure, will become a liability; adversaries can use predictable ciphertext to learn about your keys. Reusing a key and IV in counter mode is even worse. If and adversary happens to know the plaintext, they can recover the key. Cipher block chaining mode is different because a change to a single byte of ciphertext will affect all subsequent blocks.

Keys must be drawn from good sources of randomness. The `random` package is a pseudo-random number generator and not even a good one at that. Pseudo-random generators are deterministic, generating numbers that appear random to humans, but are always the same given a known seed value.

Gaze into padding and its attacks. Choose a cipher mode like AES-GCM or AEX.
