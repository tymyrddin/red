# MITRE

MITRE is a government-funded organization that puts out standards to be used by the information security community. 

## CWE and CVE
Two of the most popular of these are CWE and CVE, and they’re often confused by security practitioners. Here’s the simple distinction:

* [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org/) has to do with the vulnerability—not the instance within a product or system.
* [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/) has to do with the specific instance within a product or system—not the underlying flaw.

## CAPEC

The [Common Attack Pattern and Enumeration Classification (CAPEC)](https://capec.mitre.org/) site is an information 
resource that identifies and documents attack patterns. It also provides information on mitigation techniques
for the attacks.

## MITRE ATT&CK
MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base of tactics and techniques used by adversaries (threat actors, attackers) to compromise 
systems. The goal of MITRE ATT&CK is to use the information collected and presented in the standard as a basis for 
[threat modelling and analysis](https://tymyrddin.github.io/threat-models/). 

On the [MITRE ATT&CK website](https://attack.mitre.org/), choose a threat, read the details about the threat, and how 
the threat can be detected and mitigated. 

## Caldera
MITRE is also developing [Caldera](attack-trees:docs/lab/caldera), a C2 useful for getting started with pentesting. It contains several "Capture the Flag" tutorials.
