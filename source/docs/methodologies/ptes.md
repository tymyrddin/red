# Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

The [Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page) (NO HTTPS!) 
is a methodology for performing penetration tests. PTES breaks the penetration test down into seven phases: 
preengagement interactions, intelligence gathering, threat modeling, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, 
post-exploitation, and reporting.
