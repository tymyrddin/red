# MITRE ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base of tactics and techniques used by adversaries (threat actors, attackers) to compromise 
systems. The goal of MITRE ATT&CK is to use the information collected and presented in the standard as a basis for 
[threat modeling and analysis](https://tymyrddin.github.io/threat-models/). 

On the [MITRE ATT&CK website](https://attack.mitre.org/), choose a threat, read the details about the threat, and how 
the threat can be detected and mitigated. 

MITRE is also developing [Caldera](attack-trees:docs/lab/caldera), a C2 useful for getting started with pentesting. It contains several "Capture the Flag" tutorials.
