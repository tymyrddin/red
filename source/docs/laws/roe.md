# Rules of engagement

Rules of Engagement (RoE) are a legally binding outline of the client objectives and scope with further details of 
engagement expectations between both parties. This is the first "official" document in the engagement planning 
process and requires proper authorisation between the client and the red team. This document often acts as the 
general contract between the two parties; an external contract or other NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreement) can also be 
used.

* The format and wording of the RoE are critical since it is a legally binding contract and sets clear expectations.
* Each RoE structure will be determined by the client and red team and can vary in content length and overall sections.

It is only a summary, and its purpose is to be a legal document. Future and more in-depth planning are required to 
expand upon the RoE and client objectives. More in
