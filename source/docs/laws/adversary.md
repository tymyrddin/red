# Adversary emulation

Adversary emulation can be used to assess what a real adversary would do in an environment using their tools and 
methodologies. The red team can use known cyber kill chains to summarize and assess the steps and procedures of an 
engagement, or they can, if possible, 
[gather intelligence on and study the APT group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/) they are emulating.
