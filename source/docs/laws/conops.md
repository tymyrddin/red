# Concept of operation

The Concept of Operation (CONOPS) is a part of the plan that details a high-level overview of the proceedings of an 
engagement, comparable to an executive summary of a penetration test report. It can serve as a business/client 
reference and can be extended to further campaign plans.

There is no standard CONOPS document. Recommended is including at least:

* Client Name
* Service Provider
* Timeframe
* General Objectives/Phases
* Other Training Objectives (Exfiltration)
* High-Level Tools/Techniques planned to be used
* Threat group to emulate (if any)
