# Operations plan

As with the other red team documents, there is no standard set of operation plan templates or documents; below is an outline of example subsections within the operations plan.

 * Header
   * Personnel writing
   * Dates
   * Customer
 * Halting/stopping conditions (can be placed in ROE depending on depth)
 * Required/assigned personnel
 * Specific TTPs and attacks planned
 * Communications plan
 * Rules of Engagement (optional)

The most notable addition to this document is the communications plan, which summarises how the red team will 
communicate with other teams and the client overall. Each team will have its preferred method to communicate with 
clients.
