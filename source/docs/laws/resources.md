# Resource plan

The resource plan extends the CONOPS and includes specific details, such as dates, 
knowledge required, etc. As with most red team documents, there is no standard resource plan template

It can contain, for example: 

* Header
  *  Personnel writing
  *  Dates
  *  Customer
* Engagement Dates
  *  Reconnaissance Dates
  *  Initial Compromise Dates
  *  Post-Exploitation and Persistence Dates
  *  Misc. Dates
* Knowledge Required (optional)
  *  Reconnaissance
  *  Initial Compromise
  *  Post-Exploitation
* Resource Requirements
  * Personnel
  * Hardware
  * Cloud
  * Misc.
