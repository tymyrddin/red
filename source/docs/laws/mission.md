# Mission plan

How the mission plan is written and detailed will depend on the team; as this is an internally used document, the 
structure and detail have less impact. As with all the documents, presentation can vary; this plan can be as simple 
as emailing all operators. Below is a list of the minimum detail to be included.

 * Objectives
 * Operators
 * Exploits/Attacks
 * Targets (users/machines/objectives)
 * Execution plan variations
