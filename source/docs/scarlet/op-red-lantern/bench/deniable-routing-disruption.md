# Narrative shaping via deniable routing disruption

Create selective, deniable connectivity failures that support a broader narrative:
* “They are incompetent”
* “Their infrastructure is unreliable”
* “They cannot protect critical services”

The routing attack is not the headline. It is the *enabler*.

## Phase 0 — Context creation (outside the network)

Before any BGP UPDATE is sent, prime the environment is primed by:
* Diplomatic tension
* Economic pressure
* Information campaigns already running
* Media narratives about “fragility” or “mismanagement”

This matters because routing anomalies need a story to land.

## Phase 1 — Targeted service mapping

Identify high‑visibility services:
  * Government portals
  * Emergency services frontends
  * Media platforms
* Services that:
  * Are geographically dependent
  * Use specific upstreams or IXPs

The aim is not total outage. It is maximum embarrassment per packet.

## Phase 2 — Control‑plane foothold

As in earlier chains, we already control or influence:
* An ASN with peering reach
* One or more transit relationships

No exploitation yet. Just a position from which BGP UPDATEs will be believed.

## Phase 3 — Precision prefix interference (control‑plane attack)

This is the core BGP move. Selective, time‑bounded prefix hijack or path manipulation

Characteristics:
* Only specific prefixes
* Only certain regions
* Only during high‑visibility moments

Examples:
* Election day
* Emergency press conference
* Peak business hours

Everything remains technically “valid”:
* More‑specific announcements
* AS_PATH manipulation
* Selective route propagation

## Phase 4 — Service degradation, not outage

What users experience:
* Pages load slowly
* Video streams stutter
* “Service unavailable” appears intermittently

What operators see:
* No total loss
* No obvious hijack signature
* Conflicting reports from different regions

The ambiguity is deliberate.

## Phase 5 — Narrative amplification

Now the non‑technical part kicks in. Almost simultaneously:
* Media reports “technical failures”
* Social platforms amplify complaints
* Commentators question competence

Do not say anything. Others will do it for us. Routing instability becomes proof of a story already in circulation.

## Phase 6 — Withdrawal and deniability

Before attribution can solidify:
* Withdraw routes
* Paths return to baseline
* Monitoring graphs flatten out

Post‑incident reality:
* “Transient routing issue”
* “No evidence of attack”
* “Root cause unclear”

Perfect outcome.

## Strategic effect

What remains:
* Public doubt
* Institutional embarrassment
* Political pressure

No sanctions triggered. No red lines crossed. But credibility is dented. That damage lasts longer than the routing anomaly ever did.

## Why this is a nation‑state chain?

* Synchronised with information operations
* Exploits human interpretation, not just protocols
* Carefully scoped to avoid escalation
* Designed for plausible deniability

Criminals want payment. States want beliefs to shift.

This attack demonstrates:
* How tiny routing changes have outsized social impact
* The difference between “network down” and “network unreliable”
* Why defenders struggle to explain these incidents convincingly

Infrastructure attacks rarely stand alone. They are part of a story.
