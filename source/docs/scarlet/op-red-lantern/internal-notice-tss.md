About the lanterns

Yes, people have been testing routing. No, this is not “a project”. If you call it a project, you are buying the drinks.

A few reminders:

- If you cannot undo it, do not do it
- If you cannot explain it, definitely do not do it
- If the city notices, you have done it wrong

The point is to learn how trust moves, not to prove you are clever. We already assume that.

If a signal ends up somewhere embarrassing, fix it quietly and do not boast.

Anyone who drags the Patrician’s name into this will be asked to leave via the window.

Tea at four. Arguments encouraged. Heroics discouraged.
