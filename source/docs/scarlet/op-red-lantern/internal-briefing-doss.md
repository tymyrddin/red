# Department of Silent Stability – internal briefing (circulated, unsigned)

Subject: Irregular routing behaviour in city signalling systems

Recent observations indicate increased experimentation with signal path announcements, priority indicators, and 
route optimisation claims across multiple communication layers. While no service disruption has occurred, the patterns 
suggest deliberate exploration rather than organic failure.

Staff are reminded to:

- Monitor convergence times and trust assumptions
- Correlate signalling anomalies across guild boundaries
- Avoid visible intervention unless continuity is threatened

This activity is assessed as informationally valuable and operationally tolerable provided it remains reversible, 
non-destructive, and unpublicised.

Should any actor attempt persistence, coercion, or reputation damage, escalation protocols apply.

No further action is required at this time.
