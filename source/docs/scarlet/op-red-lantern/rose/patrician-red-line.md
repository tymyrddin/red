# The red line 

Our best guess at [the Patrician’s position](https://indigo.tymyrddin.dev/docs/vetinari/), because it was/is never 
written down.

You may observe.

You may test.

You may even mislead, briefly, to understand why belief is so fragile.

You may not:

- Cause lasting harm
- Undermine public confidence
- Create a problem that requires a speech

The moment stability becomes a topic, rather than an assumption, choices will be offered.

They will be very reasonable choices.
