# The red line 

Our best guess at [the Patrician’s position](https://indigo.tymyrddin.dev/docs/vetinari/), because it was/is never 
written down.

We may observe.

We may test.

We may even mislead, briefly, to understand why belief is so fragile.

He considers us clever. We may not:

- Cause lasting harm
- Undermine public confidence
- Create a problem that requires a speech
- Expose ourselves as "alarmingly clever"

Most importantly, the moment stability becomes a topic, rather than an assumption, he will likely offer us choices.
