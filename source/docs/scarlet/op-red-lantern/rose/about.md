# About the red lanterns (as overheard)

These were never written down.

Stated aim : *“To see what happens if the city’s routing assumptions are ... questioned.”*, said with the same tone 
one might use when wondering whether a supporting wall is load-bearing.

## What we are actually poking at

In Ankh-Morpork terms, this is *messenger routing*. In modern terms, yes, it looks suspiciously like 
*[BGP](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/in/network/roots/ip/bgp-hijacking)*.

The Scarlet Semaphore are interested in:

* Who announces routes
* Who trusts those announcements
* How quickly false paths propagate
* How long it takes for anyone sensible to notice

We are not trying to *break* the city. We are trying to find out [how easily it could be persuaded to misdeliver 
itself](gambit.md).

## Method (Semaphore style)

Very informal. ("Alarmingly clever", according to [the Patrician](patrician-red-line.md), as overheard by a clerk 
from the Dept. of Silent Stability, and former member of the Scarlet Semaphore). Everything is reversible. (Hopefully).

* False but plausible signal announcements
* Competing semaphore paths that look “more efficient”
* Gentle hijacks that reroute information without stopping it
* Observing which guilds panic first and which do not notice at all

## Relationship with the Department of Silent Stability

Officially: none.

Practically: Not just us, but everyone involved best assume we are being watched, and proceed because there is an interest.

- The Department calls this *unsanctioned resilience testing*.
- The Patrician calls it *useful information gathering*.
- We do not use those phrases in front of each other (and certainly not in public).

There seems to be a standing, unspoken rule:

* If the Department intervenes, the Operation stops immediately.
* If we do not, the findings are quietly ... shared with a person with interest.

## Risk posture

High curiosity. Moderate danger. Severe consequences *if someone gets creative without thinking* (too clever).

This is why several former Semaphore members now work for the Department. Not as punishment. As continuity.

## Current status

Ongoing, intermittently paused for tea, arguments, and ethical discussions that sound suspiciously like technical debates.

Nothing has gone wrong yet.

Which, frankly, [is making everyone more nervous than if something had](patrician-red-line.md).
