Fox hunting through the digital wilds
========================================

The wise fox knows every thicket and trail before the hunt begins. With whiskers twitching at the scent of misconfigured
services and ears pricked for the rustle of exposed APIs, we move through the digital undergrowth - silent, patient,
and lethally precise. SNMP trails glow like foxfire in our vision, LDAP directories sprawl like abandoned warrens ripe
for claiming, and those forgotten SMB shares? Fat, slow voles just waiting to be snatched. This is where we map the
territory not with clumsy tools, but with predator's instinct, marking every weak point where the forest's defences
have gone thin and brittle.

When the fox enumerates, the whole woodland becomes our larder. We nose into every hollow log (ping sweeps), test
every overhanging branch (port scans), and memorize every game trail (network routes). The old NetBIOS protocols
bleat like aging bucks, their voices carrying too far across the meadow, while misconfigured AWS buckets sit like
unguarded bird nests full of eggs. No hare is too swift, no burrow too deep - because where the security teams see
a fortified perimeter, we smell the blood in the wind and the fear-sweat of systems begging to be owned.
