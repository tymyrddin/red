The fox’s feast
======================================================

Vulnerabilities come in three flavors:

1. Known vulns: The low-effort, high-reward bugs that get patched after everyone’s already hacked you.
2. Latent vulns: Your app’s unique "features," like letting users XSS their way to admin.
3. New vulns: The zero-days are so fancy, only nation-states can afford them (for now).

Why? Because if you don’t find them first, someone else will—and they won’t send a thank-you note.
