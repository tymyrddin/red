# Vulnerability Discovery: From Known to Novel Threats

Vulnerabilities fall into three categories:

* Known: Cataloged in databases (CVE), these are targeted by automated attacks within hours of disclosure.
* Latent: Common flaw types (XSS, SQLi) unique to an appâ€™s codebase.
* Novel: Rare, high-impact vulnerabilities (e.g., zero-days) requiring advanced research.

Why? Because 60% of breaches exploit known, unpatched vulnerabilities (Ponemon Institute). Proactive discovery shrinks attack surfaces before adversaries capitalize on them.
