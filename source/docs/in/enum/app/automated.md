# Automated vulnerability scanning

Pros and cons of using [Automated vulnerability scanners](https://testlab.tymyrddin.dev/docs/enum/automated):

## Advantages

* Automated scans are easy to repeat, and the results can be shared within a team with ease.
* These scanners are quick and can test numerous applications efficiently.
* Open-source solutions exist.
* Automated scanners cover a wide range of different vulnerabilities that may be hard to manually search for.

## Disadvantages

* People can often become reliant on these tools.
* They are extremely "loud" and produce a lot of traffic and logging. This is not good if you are trying to bypass security controls.
* Open-source solutions are often basic and require expensive licenses to have useful features.
* They often do not find every vulnerability on an application.
