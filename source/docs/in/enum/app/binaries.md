# Download or obtain and decompile binaries

Download or obtain binaries and then use a decompiler to analyse the binary. Review the application in a debugger. 
Look for information such as remote systems the application connects to, database connection strings, or usernames and 
passwords used by the application (there may be a backdoor).
