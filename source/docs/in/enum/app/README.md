# Application Auditing: The Two-Pronged Approach

Application security hinges on two methodologies: dynamic analysis (testing runtime behaviour for flaws like injection or broken auth) and static analysis (inspecting source code for vulnerabilities). While tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite automate detection, manual testing uncovers logic flaws automation misses.

Why? Because 83% of breaches exploit known vulnerabilities (Verizon DBIR 2024). Comprehensive scanning reduces the window of exposureâ€”speed is critical when exploits weaponize disclosures in hours.
