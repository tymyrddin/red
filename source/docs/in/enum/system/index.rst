Scenting the digital trail
===================================================

System enumeration is like casing a joint before robbing it. You’ve got your IPs, your open ports, and that sweet, sweet list of services running on the target. Now it’s time to poke, prod, and politely ask, "Hey, is 'admin/password' still a thing here?"

Why? Because nothing ruins a hacker’s day like realising the guest account is wide open, the SMB shares are leaking like a sieve, and the security team is still on coffee break. Enumeration is your treasure map. Skip a step, and you might walk right into a firewall (literally).
