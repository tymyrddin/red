# Mapping endpoints

* Collect information to identify assets a target has across all cloud providers.
* Identify services hosted with third-party companies.
* Map out all the endpoints: user interface, APIs, subnetworks, etc. for which testing is to be done.
* Decide which endpoints to exclude based on policy restrictions, user permissions, etc.
* Decide the route for performing the pentest: from application or database.
* Figure out how well the application server and VMs can take the load of the tests.
* Find out the laws that need to be followed while performing tests.
* Figure out which tools to use and what types of tests to do on which endpoints (Automated or Manual).
* Get approval for the plan from the client and inform them when you wish to begin.
