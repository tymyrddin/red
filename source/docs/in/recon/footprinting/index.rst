Stalking your prey without getting noticed
===========================================================

Before a falcon strikes, it doesn’t just yeet itself out of the sky—it studies the landscape, learns the winds, and
picks the perfect angle. Footprinting is the same: you’re digitally creeping on your target, collecting every
breadcrumb they’ve left online. Names, networks, IPs—nothing escapes your talons. Just remember: if they notice you
lurking, you’re not a falcon anymore—you’re a seagull at a picnic.
