# Initial Scanning – Probing the Target’s defences

With reconnaissance complete, the falcon tests the wind before the strike. Initial scanning involves live host 
discovery, port enumeration, and service detection—each probe revealing vulnerabilities while avoiding detection. 
Precision here separates a successful engagement from a failed incursion.
