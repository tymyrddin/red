# Check for exposed secrets

The authentication mechanism is used to identify the user and ensure that they are authorized to access the API. 
The authentication mechanism is usually a username and password, but it can also be a token or a certificate. 
It also gives clues to potential vulnerabilities in the API. If the authentication mechanism is weak, then the 
API is more vulnerable to attack.
