Even birds need REST
======================================================

APIs are like pigeons: they look harmless until you realise how many secrets they’re carrying. You’ll poke, prod,
and politely ask for admin access (or just find an open endpoint). Either way, if you do it right, you’ll walk away
with more data than a falcon with a stolen sandwich.
