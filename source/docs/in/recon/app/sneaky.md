# Other sneaky OSINT techniques

* Engineering job listings often reveal the technologies the company uses.
* If you can’t find relevant job posts, search for employees’ profiles on LinkedIn, and read employees’ personal blogs or their engineering questions on forums like Stack Overflow and Quora.
* People’s work calendars often contain meeting notes, slides, and sometimes even login credentials. If an employee shares their calendars with the public by accident, you could gain access to these. 
* The organisation or its employees’ social media pages might also leak valuable information. Like a sets of valid credentials on Post-it Notes visible in the background of office selfies???
* If the company has an engineering mailing list, sign up for it to gain insight into the company’s technology and development process.
* Check for SlideShare or Pastebin accounts.
* Consult archive websites like the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). Tomnomnom’s tool [Waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls/) can automatically extract endpoints and URLs from the Wayback Machine.
