# Manually walk through the target

Manually walk through the application to learn more about it. Try to uncover every feature in the application that users can access by browsing through every page and clicking every link. Access the functionalities that you donâ€™t usually use.

Get a rough idea of what the attack surface (all the different points at which an attacker can attempt to exploit the application) looks like, where the data entry points are, and how different users interact with each other. Then you can start a more in-depth recon process: finding out the technology and structure of an application.
