Swoop like falcons, silent, precise, and lethally patient
=============================================================

Before a falcon strikes, it doesn’t just dive in blindly, it scouts, observes, and picks the perfect moment. Same goes
for hacking! You don’t just smash the keyboard and hope for the best (unless you’re in a bad movie). Reconnaissance
is all about stalking your digital prey, gathering intel, and finding that sweet, vulnerable spot before you strike.
So, grab your virtual falconry gloves, we’re going hunting.
