# SameSite Strict bypass via client-side redirect

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/bypassing-samesite-restrictions/lab-samesite-strict-bypass-via-client-side-redirect)'s change email function is vulnerable to CSRF. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

### Study the change email function

1. In Burp's browser, log in to the `wiener` account and change its email address.
2. In Burp, go to the **Proxy -> HTTP history** tab.
3. Study the `POST /my-account/change-email` request and notice that this doesn't contain any unpredictable tokens. It may be vulnerable to CSRF if you can bypass any `SameSite` cookie restrictions.
4. Look at the response to the `POST /login` request. The website explicitly specifies `SameSite=Strict` when setting session cookies. This prevents the browser from including these cookies in cross-site requests.

### Identify a suitable gadget

1. In the browser, go to one of the blog posts and post an arbitrary comment. Observe that you are initially sent to a confirmation page at `/post/comment/confirmation?postId=x` but, after a few seconds, you are taken back to the blog post.
2. In Burp, go to the proxy history and notice that this redirect is handled client-side using the imported JavaScript file `/resources/js/commentConfirmationRedirect.js`.
3. Study the JavaScript and notice that this uses the `postId` query parameter to dynamically construct the path for the client-side redirect.
4. In the proxy history, right-click on the `GET /post/comment/confirmation?postId=x` request and select **Copy URL**.
5. In the browser, visit this URL, but change the `postId` parameter to an arbitrary string.

```text
/post/comment/confirmation?postId=foo
```
    
6. Observe that you initially see the post confirmation page before the client-side JavaScript attempts to redirect you to a path containing the injected string `/post/foo`.
7. Try injecting a path traversal sequence so that the dynamically constructed redirect URL will point to your account page:

```text
/post/comment/confirmation?postId=1/../../my-account
```
    
8. Observe that the browser normalises this URL and successfully takes you to the MyAccount page. This confirms that the `postId` parameter can be used to elicit a `GET` request for an arbitrary endpoint on the target site.

### Bypass the SameSite restrictions

1. In the browser, go to the exploit server and create a script that induces the viewer's browser to send the GET request you just tested:

```text
<script>
    document.location = "https://0add007d0376cc05c083db48006a005c.web-security-academy.net/post/comment/confirmation?postId=../my-account";
</script>
```

2. Store and view exploit.
3. Observe that when the client-side redirect takes place, you still end up on your logged-in account page. This confirms that the browser included your authenticated session cookie in the second request, even though the initial comment-submission request was initiated from an arbitrary external site.

### Craft an exploit

1. Send the `POST /my-account/change-email` request to Burp Repeater.
2. In Burp Repeater, right-click on the request and select **Change request** method. Burp automatically generates an equivalent `GET` request.
3. Send the request. Observe that the endpoint allows you to change your email address using a `GET` request.
4. Go back to the exploit server and change the `postId` parameter in your exploit so that the redirect causes the browser to send the equivalent GET request for changing your email address:

```text
<script>
    document.location = "https://0add007d0376cc05c083db48006a005c.web-security-academy.net/post/comment/confirmation?postId=1/../../my-account/change-email?email=gotcha%40web-security-academy.net%26submit=1";
</script>
```

Note: include the `submit` parameter and URL encode the ampersand delimiter to avoid breaking out of the `postId` parameter in the initial setup request.

5. Test the exploit and confirm that it has successfully changed the email address.
6. Deliver the exploit to the victim. After a few seconds, the lab is solved. 

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to have an account.
