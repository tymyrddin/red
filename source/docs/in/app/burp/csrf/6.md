# CSRF where token is duplicated in cookie

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/bypassing-token-validation/lab-token-duplicated-in-cookie)'s email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to use the insecure "double submit" CSRF prevention technique. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Open Burp's browser and log in to your account. Submit the "Update email" form, and find the resulting request in your Proxy history.
2. Send the request to Burp Repeater and observe that the value of the `csrf` body parameter is simply being validated by comparing it with the `csrf` cookie value.
3. Perform a search, send the resulting request to Burp Repeater, and observe that the search term gets reflected in the `Set-Cookie` header. Since the search function has no CSRF protection, it can be used to inject cookies into the victim user's browser.
4. Create a URL that uses this vulnerability to `inject` a fake `csrf` cookie into the victim's browser:

```text
/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrf=fake%3b%20SameSite=None
```
    
5. Create and host a proof of concept exploit as described in the solution to the CSRF vulnerability with no defences lab (above), ensuring that your CSRF token is set to "fake". The exploit should be created from the email change request.
6. Remove the auto-submit `script` block and instead add the following code to inject the cookie:

```text
<img src="https://0a6500c504aae380c59e678d002000fb.web-security-academy.net/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrf=fake%3b%20SameSite=None" onerror="document.forms[0].submit();"/>
```

**Copy HTML** and put it in the `body` of the **Exploit server** form:

![CSRF](/_static/images/csrf3.png)

7. **Store** the exploit, then click **Deliver to victim**.

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to use the exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address, and access to two accounts.
