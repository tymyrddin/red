# SameSite Lax bypass via method override

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/bypassing-samesite-restrictions/lab-samesite-lax-bypass-via-method-override)'s change email function is vulnerable to CSRF.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

### Study the change email function

1. In Burp's browser, log in to the `wiener` account and change the email address.
2. In Burp, go to the **Proxy -> HTTP history** tab.
3. Study the `POST /my-account/change-email` request and notice that this doesn't contain any unpredictable tokens, so it may be vulnerable to CSRF if you can bypass the `SameSite` cookie restrictions.
4. Look at the response to the `POST /login` request. Notice that the website doesn't explicitly specify any `SameSite` restrictions when setting session cookies. As a result, the browser will use the default `Lax` restriction level.

This means the session cookie will be sent in cross-site `GET` requests, as long as they involve a top-level navigation.

### Bypass the SameSite restrictions

1. Send the `POST /my-account/change-email` request to Burp Repeater.
2. In Burp Repeater, right-click on the request and select **Change request method**. Burp automatically generates an equivalent GET request.
3. Send the request. The endpoint only allows POST requests.
4. Try overriding the method by adding the `_method` parameter to the query string:

```text
GET /my-account/change-email?email=oioioi%40web-security-academy.net&_method=POST HTTP/1.1
```

5. Send the request. This seems to have been accepted by the server.
6. In the browser, go to the "MyAccount" page and confirm that the email address has changed.

### Craft an exploit

1. In the browser, go to the exploit server.
2. In the Body section, create an HTML/JavaScript payload that induces the viewer's browser to issue the malicious GET request. This must cause a top-level navigation in order for the session cookie to be included:

```text
<script>
    document.location = "https://0a4d0003036b19ecc578289c00c700e6.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=evil@web-security-academy.net&_method=POST";
</script>
```

3. Store and view the exploit yourself. Confirm that this has successfully changed the email address on the target site.

4. Deliver the exploit to the victim to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to have an account.
