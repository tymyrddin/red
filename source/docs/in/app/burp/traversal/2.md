# File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-absolute-path-bypass) contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images. The application blocks traversal sequences but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Send to Repeater and modify the `filename` parameter, giving it the value `/etc/passwd`.
3. The response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file:

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
