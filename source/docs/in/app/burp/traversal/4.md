# File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-superfluous-url-decode) contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images. The application blocks input containing path traversal sequences. It then performs a URL-decode of the input before using it. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the `filename` parameter, giving it the value: `..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd`
3. The response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file:

![Traversal](/_static/images/traversal4.png)

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to encode the payload to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file
