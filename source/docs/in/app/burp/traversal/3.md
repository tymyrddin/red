# File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-sequences-stripped-non-recursively) contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images. The application strips path traversal sequences from the user-supplied filename before using it.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the `filename` parameter, giving it the value: `....//....//....//etc/passwd`
3. The response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file:

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
