# File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal/lab-validate-file-extension-null-byte-bypass) contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images. The application validates that the supplied filename ends with the expected file extension. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2. Modify the `filename` parameter, giving it the value: `../../../etc/passwd%00.png`
3. The response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
