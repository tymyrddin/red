# Information disclosure in error messages

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/information-disclosure/exploiting/lab-infoleak-in-error-messages)'s verbose error messages reveal that it is using a vulnerable version of a third-party framework.  

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. With Burp running, open one of the product pages.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that the `GET` request for product pages contains a ``productID`` parameter. Send the ``GET /product?productId=1`` request to Burp Repeater. Note that your ``productId`` might be different depending on which product page you loaded.
3. In Burp Repeater, change the value of the `productId` parameter to a non-integer data type, such as a string. Send the request.
`GET /product?productId="example"`
4. The unexpected data type causes an exception, and a full stack trace is displayed in the response. This reveals that the lab is using `Apache Struts 2 2.3.31`.
5. Go back to the lab, click "Submit solution", and enter **2 2.3.31** to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to obtain and submit the version number of this framework.
