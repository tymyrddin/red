# Information disclosure on debug page

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/information-disclosure/exploiting/lab-infoleak-on-debug-page) contains a debug page that discloses sensitive information about the application.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. With Burp running, browse to the home page.
2. Go to the **Target -> Site Map** tab. Right-click on the top-level entry for the lab and select **Engagement tools -> Find comments**. The home page contains an HTML comment that contains a link called **Debug**. This points to `/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php`.

3. In the site map, right-click on the entry for `/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php` and select **Send to Repeater**.
4. In Burp Repeater, send the request to retrieve the file. It reveals debugging information, including the ``SECRET_KEY`` environment variable.
5. Go back to the lab, click **Submit solution**, and enter the `SECRET_KEY` to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to obtain and submit the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
