# Authentication bypass via information disclosure

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/information-disclosure/exploiting/lab-infoleak-authentication-bypass)'s administration interface has an authentication bypass vulnerability, but it is impractical to exploit without knowledge of a custom HTTP header used by the front-end. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. In Burp Repeater, browse to `GET /admin`. The response discloses that the admin panel is only accessible if logged in as an administrator, or if requested from a local IP.
2. Send the request again, but this time use the `TRACE` method: `TRACE /admin`
3. Study the response. Notice that the ``X-Custom-IP-Authorization`` header, containing your IP address, was automatically appended to your request. This is used to determine whether the request came from the `localhost` IP address.
4. Go to **Proxy -> Options**, scroll down to the **Match and Replace** section, and click **Add**. Leave the match condition blank, but in the **Replace** field, enter `X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1`. Burp Proxy will now add this header to every request you send.

5. Browse to the home page. You now have access to the admin panel, where you can delete Carlos.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; obtain the header name then use it to bypass the lab's authentication; and access the admin interface to delete Carlos's account.
