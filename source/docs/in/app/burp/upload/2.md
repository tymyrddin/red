# Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-content-type-restriction-bypass) contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page. 
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy -> HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a ``GET`` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater. 
3. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php`, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:

```text
 <?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?> 
```

4. Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. 

```text
Sorry, file type application/x-php is not allowed Only image/jpeg and image/png are allowed Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.

ï¿½ Back to My Account
```

The response indicates that you are only allowed to upload files with the MIME type `image/jpeg` or `image/png`.

5. In Burp, go back to the proxy history and find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload. Send this to Burp Repeater. 
6. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the `POST /my-account/avatar` request. In the part of the message body related to your file, change the specified `Content-Type` to `image/jpeg`.
7. Send the request. 

![File upload](/_static/images/upload2.png)

The response indicates that your file was successfully uploaded.

8. Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with `exploit.php` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response. 
9. Submit the secret to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.
