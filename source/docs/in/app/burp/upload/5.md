# Web shell upload via obfuscated file extension

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-web-shell-upload-via-obfuscated-file-extension) contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defence can be bypassed using a classic obfuscation technique. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy -> HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`.
3. Send this request to Burp Repeater. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php`, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:

```text
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```

4. Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. The response indicates that you are only allowed to upload JPG and PNG files.

```text
Sorry, only JPG & PNG files are allowed Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.

ï¿½ Back to My Account
```

5. In Burp's proxy history, find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload. Send this to Burp Repeater.
6. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab for the `POST /my-account/avatar` request and find the part of the body that relates to your PHP file. In the `Content-Disposition` header, change the value of the `filename` parameter to include a URL encoded null byte, followed by the `.jpg` extension:
`filename="exploit.php%00.jpg"`
7. Send the request:

![File upload](/_static/images/upload11.png)

The file was successfully uploaded. Notice that the message refers to the file as `exploit.php`, suggesting that the null byte and `.jpg` extension have been stripped. 

8. Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with `exploit.php` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response.

9. Submit the secret to solve the lab. 

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`; and then enter this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.
