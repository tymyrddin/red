# Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities

## Description

[This online shop](https://portswigger.net/web-security/websockets/lab-manipulating-messages-to-exploit-vulnerabilities) has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets. Chat messages that you submit are viewed by a support agent in real time. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Click **Live chat** and send a chat message. 
2. In Burp Proxy, go to the WebSockets history tab, and observe that the chat message has been sent via a WebSocket message.
3. Using your browser, send a new message containing a `<` character. In Burp Proxy, find the corresponding WebSocket message and observe that the `<` has been HTML-encoded by the client before sending.

```text
{"message":"&lt;"}
```

4. Ensure that Burp Proxy is configured to intercept WebSocket messages, then send another chat message.
5. Edit the intercepted message to contain the payload: 

```text
<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>
```

6. Observe that an alert is triggered in your browser. This will also happen in the support agent's browser.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to use a WebSocket message to trigger an `alert()` popup in the support agent's browser.
