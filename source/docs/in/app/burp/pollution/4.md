# Client-side prototype pollution in third-party libraries

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution/finding/lab-prototype-pollution-client-side-prototype-pollution-in-third-party-libraries) is vulnerable to DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution. This is due to a gadget in a third-party library, which is easy to miss due to the minified source code. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Load the lab in Burp's built-in browser.
2. Enable [DOM Invader](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/dom-invader) and enable the prototype pollution option.
3. Open the browser DevTools panel, go to the **DOM Invader** tab, then reload the page.
4. Observe that **DOM Invader** has identified two prototype pollution vectors in the hash property i.e. the URL fragment string.
5. Click **Scan for gadgets**. A new tab opens in which **DOM Invader** begins scanning for gadgets using the selected source.
6. When the scan is complete, open the DevTools panel in the same tab as the scan, then go to the **DOM Invader** tab.
7. Observe that **DOM Invader** has successfully accessed the `setTimeout()` sink via the `hitCallback` gadget.
8. Click Exploit. **DOM Invader** automatically generates a proof-of-concept exploit and calls `alert(1)`.

```

9. Disable **DOM Invader**.
10. In the browser, go to the lab's exploit server.
11. In the Body section, craft an exploit that will navigate the victim to a malicious URL:

```text
<script>
    location="https://0a76003f03e6226bc0df1817002a00bc.web-security-academy.net/#__proto__[hitCallback]=alert%28document.cookie%29"
</script>
```

12. Test the exploit on yourself, making sure that you're navigated to the lab's home page and that the `alert(document.cookie)` payload is triggered.
13. Go back to the exploit server and deliver the exploit to the victim to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to use DOM Invader to identify a prototype pollution and a gadget for DOM XSS; and use the exploit server to deliver a payload to the victim that calls `alert(document.cookie)` in their browser.

Although it's technically possible to solve this lab manually, using [DOM Invader](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/dom-invader) is recommended as this will save a considerable amount of time and effort.
