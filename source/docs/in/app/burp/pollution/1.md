# DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution/finding/lab-prototype-pollution-dom-xss-via-client-side-prototype-pollution) is vulnerable to DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

### Find a prototype pollution source

1. In browser, try polluting the `Object.prototype` by injecting an arbitrary property via the query string:

```text
/?__proto__[foo]=bar
```

2. Open the browser DevTools panel and go to the Console tab.
3. Enter `Object.prototype`.
4. Study the properties of the returned object. Observe that it now has a `foo` property with the value bar. You've successfully found a prototype pollution source.

### Identify a gadget

1. In the browser DevTools panel, go to the Sources tab.
2. Study the JavaScript files that are loaded by the target site and look for any DOM XSS sinks.
3. In `searchLogger.js`, notice that if the config object has a `transport_url` property, this is used to dynamically append a script to the DOM.

4. Notice that no `transport_url` property is defined for the `config` object. This is a potential gadget for controlling the `src` of the `script` element.

### Craft an exploit

1. Using the prototype pollution source you identified earlier, try injecting an arbitrary `transport_url` property:

```text
/?__proto__[transport_url]=foo
```

2. In the browser DevTools panel, go to the Elements tab and study the HTML content of the page. Observe that a `script` element has been rendered on the page, with the `src` attribute `foo`.
3. Modify the payload in the URL to inject an XSS proof-of-concept. For example, you can use a `data: URL`:

```text
/?__proto__[transport_url]=data:,alert(1);
```

4. Observe that the `alert(1)` is called and the lab is solved.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to find a source that can be used to add arbitrary properties to the global `Object.prototype`; identify a gadget property that allows for executing arbitrary JavaScript; combine these to call `alert()`.

This lab can be solved manually in a browser, or by using [DOM Invader](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/dom-invader).
