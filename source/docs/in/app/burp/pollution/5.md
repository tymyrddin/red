# Client-side prototype pollution via browser APIs

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution/browser-apis/lab-prototype-pollution-client-side-prototype-pollution-via-browser-apis) is vulnerable to DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution. The website's developers have noticed a potential gadget and attempted to patch it. However, you can bypass the measures they've taken. Also see [Widespread prototype pollution gadgets](https://portswigger.net/research/widespread-prototype-pollution-gadgets).

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Load the lab in Burp's built-in browser.
2. Enable [DOM Invader](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/dom-invader) and enable the prototype pollution option.
3. Open the browser DevTools panel, go to the **DOM Invader** tab, then reload the page.
4. Observe that **DOM Invader** has identified two prototype pollution vectors in the search property i.e. the query string.
5. Click **Scan for gadgets**. A new tab opens in which **DOM Invader** begins scanning for gadgets using the selected source.
6. When the scan is complete, open the DevTools panel in the same tab as the scan, then go to the **DOM Invader** tab.
7. Observe that **DOM Invader** has successfully accessed the `script.src` sink via the value gadget.
8. Click Exploit. **DOM Invader** automatically generates a proof-of-concept exploit and calls `alert(1)`.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to find a source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global `Object.prototype`; identify a gadget property that allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript; and combine these to call `alert()`.
