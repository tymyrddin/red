# Privilege escalation via server-side prototype pollution

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution/server-side/lab-privilege-escalation-via-server-side-prototype-pollution) is built on `Node.js` and the `Express` framework. It is vulnerable to server-side prototype pollution because it unsafely merges user-controllable input into a server-side JavaScript object. This is simple to detect because any polluted properties inherited via the prototype chain are visible in an HTTP response.

## Reproduction and PoCs

### Study the address change feature

1. Log in and visit your account page. Submit the form for updating your billing and delivery address.
2. In Burp, go to the **Proxy -> HTTP history** tab and find the `POST /my-account/change-address` request.
3. When submitting the form, the data from the fields is sent to the server as JSON. The server responds with a JSON object that appears to represent your user. This has been updated to reflect the new address information.
4. Send the request to Burp Repeater.

### Identify a prototype pollution source

1. In Repeater, add a new property to the JSON with the name `__proto__`, containing an object with an arbitrary property:

```text
"__proto__": {
    "foo":"bar"
}
```

2. Send the request.
3. Notice that the object in the response now includes the arbitrary property that you injected, but no `__proto__` property. This strongly suggests that you have successfully polluted the object's prototype and that your property has been inherited via the prototype chain.

### Identify a gadget

1. Look at the additional properties in the response body.
2. Notice the `isAdmin` property, which is currently set to false.

### Craft an exploit

1. Modify the request to try polluting the prototype with your own `isAdmin` property:

```text
"__proto__": {
    "isAdmin":true
}
```

2. Send the request. Notice that the `isAdmin` value in the response has been updated. This suggests that the object doesn't have its own `isAdmin` property, but has instead inherited it from the polluted prototype.
3. In the browser, refresh the page and confirm that you now have a link to access the **admin panel**.
4. Go to the admin panel and delete the user carlos to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to find a prototype pollution source that can be used to add arbitrary properties to the global `Object.prototype`; identify a gadget property that can be used to escalate  privileges; then access the admin panel and delete the user carlos.
