# 2FA simple bypass

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-simple-bypass)'s two-factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password (`wiener:peter` and `carlos:montoya`), but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code.  

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in to your own account `wiener:peter`. Your 2FA verification code will be sent to you by email. Click the **Email client** button to access your emails.
2. Go to your account page and make a note of the URL.

```text
https://0ae300ee036172afc23f703800b90085.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=wiener
```

3. Log out of your account.
4. Log in using the victim's credentials `carlos:montoya`.
5. When prompted for the verification code, manually change the URL to navigate to ``/my-account``. The lab is solved when the page loads.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to access Carlos's account page.
