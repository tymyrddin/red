Insecure deserialisation is when user-controllable data is deserialised by an app.

Insecure deserialisation remains a high-severity threat, though itâ€™s less common than XSS or SQLi. However,
when exploited, it often leads to remote code execution (RCE), data tampering, or privilege escalation.

It still exists in APIs & microservices (JSON/XML/YAML parsers), legacy systems (Java/C# serialization, Python pickle),
and DevOps Tools (CI/CD pipelines, configuration files).

It is worth testing for it in apps that use Java/C# binary serialization, Python pickle, or PHP `unserialize()`,
process JWT, XML, or YAML from untrusted sources, and apps that handle session cookies or API tokens with custom
encoding.
