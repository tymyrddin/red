# SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-determine-number-of-columns) contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. The first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter. 
2. Modify the category parameter, giving it the value `'+UNION+SELECT+NULL--`. Note that an error occurs.
3. Modify the category parameter to add another column containing a null value: `'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--`
4. Continue adding null values until the error disappears and the response includes additional content containing the null values.

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing an SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing null values.
