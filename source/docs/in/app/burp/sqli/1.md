# SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-event-handlers-and-href-attributes-blocked) an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
2. Modify the category parameter, adding a `'`
3. Create payload, submit the request, and verify that the response now contains additional items.

```text
https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Pets' OR 1=1 -- 
```

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.
