# SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/lab-login-bypass) contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. SQL:

```text
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND password = '' OR 1=1 --
```
    
2. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the login request.

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to perform an SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the `administrator` user.
