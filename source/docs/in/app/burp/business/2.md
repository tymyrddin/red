# High-level logic vulnerability

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-high-level) doesn't adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. With Burp running, log in with `wiener:peter` and add a cheap item to your cart.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy -> HTTP history** and study the corresponding HTTP messages. Notice that the quantity is determined by a parameter in the ``POST /cart`` request.
3. Go to the **Intercept** tab and turn on interception. Add another item to your cart and go to the intercepted ``POST /cart`` request in Burp.
4. Change the ``quantity`` parameter to an arbitrary integer, then forward any remaining requests. Observe that the quantity in the cart was successfully updated based on your input.
5. Repeat this process, but request a negative quantity this time. Check that this is successfully deducted from the cart quantity.
6. Request a suitable negative quantity to remove more units from the cart than it currently contains. Confirm that you have successfully forced the cart to contain a negative quantity of the product. Go to your cart and notice that the total price is now also a negative amount.
7. Add the leather jacket to your cart as normal. Add a suitable negative quantity of the another item to reduce the total price to less than your remaining store credit.
8. Place the order to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in and buy a "Lightweight l33t leather jacket" for a price way less than intended.
