Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of an application that allow an attacker
to elicit unintended behaviour. This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve
a malicious goal.

Business (application) logic flaws are often the most critical in terms of consequences, as they are deeply tied into
the company's process.

These vulnerabilities exist in about a third of apps because they are often overlooked by automated scanners.
