# Inconsistent security controls

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-inconsistent-security-controls)'s flawed logic allows arbitrary users to access administrative functionality that should only be available to company employees.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Open the lab then go to the **Target -> Site map** tab in Burp. Right-click on the lab domain and select **Engagement tools -> Discover content** to open the content discovery tool.
2. Click **Session is not running** to start the content discovery. After a short while, look at the **Site map** tab in the dialog. Notice that it discovered the path `/admin`.
3. Try and browse to `/admin`. Although you don't have access, the error message indicates that `DontWannaCry` users do.

4. Go to the account registration page. Notice the message telling `DontWannaCry` employees to use their company email address. Register with an arbitrary email address in the format:

```text
attacker@exploit-0acf004f04439081c1c91280010e0052.exploit-server.net
```

Find your email domain name by clicking the **Email client** button.

5. Go to the email client and click the link in the confirmation email to complete the registration.
6. Log in using your new account and go to the **My account** page. Notice that you have the option to change your email address. Change your email address to an arbitrary ``@dontwannacry.com`` address.

7. Notice that you now have access to the admin panel, where you can delete Carlos to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to access the admin panel and delete Carlos.
