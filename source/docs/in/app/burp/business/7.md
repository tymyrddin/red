# Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-weak-isolation-on-dual-use-endpoint) makes a flawed assumption about the user's privilege level based on their input. As a result, it is possible to exploit the logic of its account management features to gain access to arbitrary users' accounts. 

## Reproduction

1. With Burp running, log in with `wiener:peter` and access the account page.
2. Change the password.
3. Study the `POST /my-account/change-password` request in Burp Repeater.
4. Notice that if you remove the `current-password` parameter entirely, you are able to successfully change the password without providing the current one.
5. The user whose password is changed is determined by the `username` parameter. Set `username=administrator` and send the request again.
6. Log out and notice that you can now successfully log in as the `administrator` using the password just set.
7. Go to the **admin panel** and delete Carlos to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in; access the administrator account and delete Carlos.
