# OS command injection, simple case

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-simple) contains an OS command injection vulnerability in the product stock checker: The application executes a shell command containing user-supplied product and store IDs, and returns the raw output from the command in its response. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that checks the stock level. 
2. Modify the `storeID` parameter, giving it the value `1|whoami`. 

```text
productId=1&storeId=1|whoami
```

3. Observe that the response contains the name of the current user.

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Connection: close
Content-Length: 13

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to execute the `whoami` command to determine the name of the current user.
