Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located
outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP).

The vulnerabilities can be found in APIs, SPAs, and cloud services.

It persists because developers often misconfigure Access-Control-Allow-Origin (e.g., wildcards * with credentials), and
complex architectures (microservices, CDNs) introduce edge-case flaws.
