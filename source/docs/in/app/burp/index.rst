Portswigger Academy labs: Controlled burn
=========================================

Burp Academy’s labs are the greenhouse of web app hacking—neatly potted vulnerabilities, each labeled and pre-pruned
for your exploitation pleasure. Here, CSRF vines are trimmed for optimal poisoning, SSRF saplings sprout in predictable
patches, and even the JWT blossoms crack under gentle pressure. It’s hacking with training wheels, where every lab is
a perfect, pesticide-free specimen of exactly how things go wrong in the wild. The catch? Real orchards are messier,
and the worms are hungrier.
