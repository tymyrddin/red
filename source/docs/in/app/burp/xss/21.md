# Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with single quote and backslash escaped

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-string-single-quote-backslash-escaped) contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string with single quotes and backslashes escaped.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Enter a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp to intercept the search request and send it to Burp Repeater.
2. Note the random string has been reflected inside a JavaScript string.
3. Try sending the payload `test'payload` and observe that your single quote gets backslash-escaped, preventing you from breaking out of the string.
4. Replace the input with the following payload to break out of the script block and inject a new script:

```text
</script><script>alert(1)</script>
```
    
5. Verify the technique worked by right-clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. When you load the page it should trigger an alert.
