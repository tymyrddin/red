# DOM XSS in jQuery anchor href attribute sink using location.search source

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-jquery-href-attribute-sink) contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the submit feedback page. It uses the jQuery library's `$` selector function to find an anchor element, and changes its `href` attribute using data from `location.search`.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. On the Submit feedback page, change the query parameter returnPath to `/` followed by a random alphanumeric string.
2. Right-click and inspect the element, and observe that your random string has been placed inside an `a href` attribute.
3. Change returnPath to:

```text
javascript:alert(document.cookie)
```

For example:

    https://0a1800ac03209537c12be0bd005f00f0.web-security-academy.net/feedback?returnPath=javascript:alert(document.cookie)
    
4. Hit enter and click the `Back` button on the site to trigger the attack.
