# DOM XSS in AngularJS expression with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-angularjs-expression) contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in a AngularJS expression within the search functionality.

AngularJS is a popular JavaScript library, which scans the contents of HTML nodes containing the `ng-app` attribute (also known as an AngularJS directive). When a directive is added to the HTML code, you can execute JavaScript expressions within double curly braces. This technique is useful when angle brackets are being encoded. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Enter an alphanumeric string into the search box.
2. View the page source and observe that your random string is enclosed in an `ng-app` directive.

```text
<body ng-app="" class="ng-scope">
...
</body>
```

3. Enter the following AngularJS expression in the search box:

```text
{{$on.constructor('alert(1)')()}}
```

4. Click search.
