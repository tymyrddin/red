# Reflected XSS in canonical link tag

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-canonical-link-tag) reflects user input in a canonical link tag and escapes angle brackets. _Note: The solution to this lab is only possible in Chrome._

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Visit the following URL, replacing `lab-id` with your lab ID:
 
```text
https://0a8e007b03ebd129c06bf93500c800bd.web-security-academy.net/?%27accesskey=%27x%27onclick=%27alert(1)
```

This sets the X key as an access key for the whole page. When a user presses the access key, the alert function is called.

2. To trigger the exploit, press one of the following key combinations:
* On Windows: ALT+SHIFT+X
* On MacOS: CTRL+ALT+X
* On Linux: Alt+X
