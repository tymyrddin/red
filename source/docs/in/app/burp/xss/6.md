# DOM XSS in jQuery selector sink using a hashchange event

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-jquery-selector-hash-change-event) contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability on the home page. It uses jQuery's `$()` selector function to auto-scroll to a given post, whose title is passed via the `location.hash` property.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Notice the vulnerable code on the home page using Burp or the browser's DevTools. 

```text
<script>
    $(window).on('hashchange', function(){
        var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')');
        if (post) post.get(0).scrollIntoView();
    });
</script>
```

A [Jquery hashchange](https://github.com/apopelo/jquery-hashchange) event tracks URL history changes. When a change happens, `decodeURIComponent` is called on the `window.location.hash`. If that part of the page exists, the browser scrolls to it.

2. Create exploit:

```text
<iframe src="https://lab-id.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=1 onerror=print(1)>'">
```

3. From the lab banner, open the exploit server.
4. For delivery, up top click on Go To Exploit Server, enter the exploit in the body field and **Store** the changes.

5. Then click **View Exploit** to try it out on yourself. If that worked, click **Deliver Exploit to Victim**.
