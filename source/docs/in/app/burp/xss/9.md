# Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets HTML encoded

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-javascript-string-angle-brackets-html-encoded) contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality where angle brackets are encoded. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string. Also see the HackTricks XSS page, in the section on [Inside JavaScript code](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting#inside-javascript-code).

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Put a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp Suite to intercept the search request and send it to Burp Repeater.

```text
<script>
    var searchTerms = '&lt;alphanumeric';
    document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+encodeURIComponent(searchTerms)+'">');
</script>
```

2. The random string has been reflected inside a JavaScript string: The script accepts input, assigns it to the variable `searchTerms`, and does a `document.write` with the encoded URL using `encodeURIComponent`.
3. Replace the input with this payload to break out of the JavaScript string and inject an alert:
 
```text
'-alert('XSS')-'
```
