# DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based/lab-document-write-sink) contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. It uses the JavaScript `document.write` function, which writes data out to the page. The `document.write` function is called with data from `location.search`, which can be controlled using the website URL.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Enter a random alphanumeric string into the search box.
2. Right-click and inspect the element, and observe that your random string has been placed inside an `img src` attribute.

```text

```
