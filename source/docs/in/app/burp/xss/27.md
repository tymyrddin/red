# Reflected XSS with AngularJS sandbox escape without strings

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/client-side-template-injection/lab-angular-sandbox-escape-without-strings) uses AngularJS in an unusual way where the $eval function is not available and you will be unable to use any strings in AngularJS. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Visit the following URL, replacing `0ae600ec04b3716dc12345280056003b` with your lab ID:

```text
https://0ae600ec04b3716dc12345280056003b.web-security-academy.net/?search=1&toString().constructor.prototype.charAt%3d[].join;[1]|orderBy:toString().constructor.fromCharCode(120,61,97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41)=1
```

The exploit uses `toString()` to create a string without using quotes. It then gets the String prototype and overwrites the `charAt` function for every string. This effectively breaks the AngularJS sandbox. Next, an array is passed to the `orderBy` filter. We then set the argument for the filter by again using `toString()` to create a string and the String constructor property. Finally, we use the `fromCharCode` method to generate the payload by converting character codes into the string `x=alert(1)`. Because the `charAt` function has been overwritten, AngularJS will allow this code where normally it would not.
