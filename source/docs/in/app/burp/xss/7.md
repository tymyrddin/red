# Reflected XSS into attribute with angle brackets HTML-encoded

## Description

The website in [this lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-attribute-angle-brackets-html-encoded) contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality where angle brackets are HTML-encoded.

Also see the leads from HackTricks concerning [XSS methodology](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting#methodology) and [XSS Inside HTML tags attribute](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting#inside-html-tags-attribute): _2. If you can escape from the attribute but not from the tag (-> is encoded or deleted), depending on the tag you could create an event that executes JS code:_

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Put a random alphanumeric string in the search box, then use Burp Suite to intercept the search request and send it to Burp Repeater.
2. The random string has been reflected inside a quoted attribute.
3. Replace the input with a payload to escape the quoted attribute and inject an event handler:

```text
" autofocus onfocus=alert(1) x="
```

4. Verify the technique worked by right-clicking, selecting "Copy URL", and pasting the URL in the browser. When you move the mouse over the injected element it should trigger an alert.

The resulting HTML:

```text
<section class=blog-header>
    <h1>0 search results for '&quot; autofocus onfocus=alert(1) x=&quot;'</h1>
    <hr>
</section>
```
