# Method-based access control can be circumvented

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-method-based-access-control-can-be-circumvented) implements access controls based partly on the HTTP method of requests. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials `administrator:admin`. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in using the admin credentials `administrator:admin`.
2. Browse to the admin panel, promote `carlos`, and send the HTTP request to Burp Repeater.
3. Open a private/incognito browser window, and log in with the non-admin credentials `wiener:peter`.
4. Attempt to re-promote `carlos` with the non-admin user by copying that user's session cookie into the existing Burp Repeater request, and observe that the response says "Unauthorized".
5. Change the method from `POST` to `POSTX` and observe that the response changes to "missing parameter".
6. Convert the request to use the `GET` method by right-clicking and selecting "Change request method".
7. Change the username parameter to your username and resend the request.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to exploit the flawed access controls to become an administrator.
