# User role controlled by request parameter

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-role-controlled-by-request-parameter) has an admin panel at `/admin`, which identifies administrators using a forgeable cookie. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Browse to `/admin` and observe that you can't access the admin panel.
2. Browse to the login page.
3. In Burp Proxy, turn interception on and enable response interception.
4. Login with credentials `wiener:peter`, and forward the resulting request in Burp.
5. Observe that the response sets the cookie `Admin=false`. Change it to `Admin=true`.
6. Load the admin panel (keep setting Admin to `true`) and delete `carlos`.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to access the admin panel, and use it to delete the user `carlos`.
