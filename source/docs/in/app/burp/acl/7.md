# User ID controlled by request parameter with data leakage in redirect

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-id-controlled-by-request-parameter-with-data-leakage-in-redirect) contains an access control vulnerability where sensitive information is leaked in the body of a redirect response.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in with `wiener:peter` and access the account page.
2. Send the request to Burp Repeater.
3. Change the "id" parameter to `carlos`.
4. Observe that although the response is now redirecting you to the home page, it has a body containing the API key belonging to `carlos`.
5. Submit the API key.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in, obtain the API key for the user `carlos` and submit it as the solution.
