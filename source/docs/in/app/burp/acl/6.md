# User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-id-controlled-by-request-parameter-with-unpredictable-user-ids) has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page, but identifies users with GUIDs. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Find a blog post by ``carlos``.
2. Click on ``carlos`` and observe that the URL contains his user ID. Make a note of this ID.

```text
https://0a5c000f033d4106c25eb15600bc00a8.web-security-academy.net/blogs?userId=05bac43e-8599-476a-8650-16514c64a2d9
```

3. Log in with `wiener:peter` and access the account page.
4. Change the "id" parameter to the saved user ID.
5. Retrieve and submit the API key.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in, find the GUID for `carlos`, then submit his API key as the solution.
