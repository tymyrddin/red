# Referer-based access control

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-referer-based-access-control) controls access to certain admin functionality based on the Referer header. _You can familiarise yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials `administrator:admin`._

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in using the admin credentials `administrator:admin`.
2. Browse to the admin panel, promote `carlos`, and send the HTTP request to Burp Repeater.
3. Open a private/incognito browser window, and log in with the non-admin credentials.
4. Browse to `/admin-roles?username=carlos&action=upgrade` and observe that the request is treated as unauthorised due to the absent Referer header.
5. Copy the non-admin user's session cookie into the existing Burp Repeater request, change the username to yours, and replay it.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to log in using the credentials `wiener:peter` and exploit the flawed access controls to become an administrator.
