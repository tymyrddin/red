# Insecure direct object references

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-insecure-direct-object-references) stores user chat logs directly on the server's file system, and retrieves them using static URLs. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Select the **Live chat** tab.
2. Send a message and then select **View transcript**.
3. Review the URL and observe that the transcripts are text files assigned a filename containing an incrementing number.
4. Change the filename to `1.txt` and review the text. Notice a password within the chat transcript.
5. Return to the main lab page and log in using the stolen credentials.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to find the password for the user `carlos`, and log into their account.
