# User ID controlled by request parameter with password disclosure

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-user-id-controlled-by-request-parameter-with-password-disclosure) has user account page that contains the current user's existing password, prefilled in a masked input. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in with `wiener:peter`, and access the user account page.
2. Change the "id" parameter in the URL to ``administrator``.
3. View the response in Burp and observe that it contains the administrator's password.
4. Log in to the administrator account and delete ``carlos``.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to retrieve the administrator's password, then use it to delete `carlos`.
