# Unprotected admin functionality

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality) has an unprotected admin panel. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Go to the lab and view ``robots.txt`` by appending ``/robots.txt`` to the lab URL. Notice that the ``Disallow`` line discloses the path to the admin panel.
2. In the URL bar, replace ``/robots.txt`` with ``/administrator-panel`` to load the admin panel.
3. Delete ``carlos``.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to delete the user `carlos`.
