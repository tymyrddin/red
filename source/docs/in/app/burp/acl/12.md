# Multistep process with no access control on one step

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-multi-step-process-with-no-access-control-on-one-step) has an admin panel with a flawed multi-step process for changing a user's role. _You can familiarise yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials `administrator:admin`._ 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in using the admin credentials `administrator:admin`.
2. Browse to the admin panel, promote `carlos`, and send the confirmation HTTP request to Burp Repeater.
3. Open a private/incognito browser window, and log in with the non-admin credentials `wiener:peter`.
4. Copy the non-admin user's session cookie into the existing Repeater request, change the username to yours, and replay it.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to exploit the flawed access controls to become an administrator.
