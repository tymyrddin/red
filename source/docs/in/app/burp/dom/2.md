# DOM XSS using web messages and a JavaScript URL

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/controlling-the-web-message-source/lab-dom-xss-using-web-messages-and-a-javascript-url) demonstrates a DOM-based redirection vulnerability that is triggered by web messaging.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Analysis:

```text
<script>
    window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
        var url = e.data;
        if (url.indexOf('http:') > -1 || url.indexOf('https:') > -1) {
            location.href = url;
        }
    }, false);
</script>
```

The home page contains an `addEventListener()` call that listens for a web message. The JavaScript contains a flawed `indexOf()` check that looks for the strings `http:` or `https:` anywhere within the web message. It also contains the sink `location.href`.

And see [Window.postMessage()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage):

In this lab, a payload can be transported in the message, while the `targetOrigin` is the target domain or a * as a synonym for the full world:

```text
<iframe src="URL" onload="contentWindow.postMessage('PAYLOAD','*');">
```

2. Go to the exploit server and add this `iframe` to the body:

3. **Store** the exploit and deliver it to the victim.

This script sends a web message containing an arbitrary JavaScript payload, along with the string `http:`. The second argument specifies that any `targetOrigin` is allowed for the web message.

When the iframe loads, the `postMessage()` method sends the JavaScript payload to the main page. The event listener spots the `http:` string and proceeds to send the payload to the `location.href` sink, where the `print()` function is called.

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to construct an HTML page on the exploit server that exploits this vulnerability and calls the `print()` function.
