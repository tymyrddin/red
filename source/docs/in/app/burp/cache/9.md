# URL normalisation

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-normalization) contains an XSS vulnerability that is not directly exploitable due to browser URL-encoding. 

## Reproduction

1. In Burp Repeater, browse to any non-existent path, such as `GET /random`. The path requested is reflected in the error message.
2. Add a suitable reflected XSS payload to the request line:

```text
GET /random</p><script>alert(1)</script><p>foo
```

3. Requesting this URL in the browser, the payload does not execute because it is URL-encoded.
4. In Burp Repeater, poison the cache with the payload and then immediately load the URL in the browser. This time, the `alert()` is executed because the browser's encoded payload was URL-decoded by the cache, causing a cache hit with the earlier request.
5. Re-poison the cache then immediately go to the lab and click "Deliver link to victim". Submit the malicious URL. The lab will be solved when the victim visits the link.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to find the XSS vulnerability, poison the cache to inject a payload that will execute `alert(1)` in the victim's browser; and then deliver the malicious URL to the victim.
