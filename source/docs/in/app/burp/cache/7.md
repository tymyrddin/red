# Parameter cloaking

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-param-cloaking) is vulnerable to web cache poisoning because it excludes a certain parameter from the cache key. There is also inconsistent parameter parsing between the cache and the back-end. A user regularly visits this site's home page using Chrome. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Identify that the ``utm_content`` parameter is supported. Observe that it is also excluded from the cache key.
2. Notice that if you use a semicolon (;) to append another parameter to utm_content, the cache treats this as a single parameter. This means that the extra parameter is also excluded from the cache key. Alternatively, with Param Miner loaded, right-click on the request and select "Bulk scan" > "Rails parameter cloaking scan" to identify the vulnerability automatically.
3. Observe that every page imports the script ``/js/geolocate.js``, executing the callback function ``setCountryCookie()``. Send the request ``GET /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie`` to Burp Repeater.
4. Notice that you can control the name of the function that is called on the returned data by editing the ``callback`` parameter. However, you can't poison the cache for other users in this way because the parameter is keyed.
5. Study the cache behaviour. Observe that if you add duplicate `callback` parameters, only the final one is reflected in the response, but both are still keyed. However, if you append the second `callback` parameter to the `utm_content` parameter using a semicolon, it is excluded from the cache key and still overwrites the callback function in the response:

6. Send the request again, but this time pass in `alert(1)` as the callback function:

```text
GET /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie&utm_content=foo;callback=alert(1)
```

7. Get the response cached, then load the home page in your browser. Check that the `alert()` is triggered.
8. Replay the request to keep the cache poisoned. The lab will solve when the victim user visits any page containing this resource import URL.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to use the parameter cloaking technique to poison the cache with a response that executes `alert(1)` in the victim's browser.
