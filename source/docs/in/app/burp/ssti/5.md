# Server-side template injection with information disclosure via user-supplied objects

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection/exploiting/lab-server-side-template-injection-with-information-disclosure-via-user-supplied-objects) is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the way an object is being passed into the template. This vulnerability can be exploited to access sensitive data. 

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in with `content-manager:C0nt3ntM4n4g3r` and edit one of the product description templates.
2. Change one of the template expressions to something invalid, such as a fuzz string ``${{<%[%'"}}%\``, and save the template. 

```text
Internal Server Error

Traceback (most recent call last): File "<string>", line 11, in <module> File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/template/base.py", line 191,...
```

The error message in the output hints that the [Django framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/) is being used.

3. Study the Django documentation and notice that the [built-in template tag debug](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/messages/#message-tags) can be called to display debugging information.
4. In the template, remove your invalid syntax and enter the following statement to invoke the ``debug`` built-in:

```text
{% debug %}
```

5. Save the template. The output will contain a list of objects and properties to which you have access from within this template. Crucially, notice that you can access the ``settings`` object.

```text
{'product': {'name': 'Pest Control Umbrella', 'price': '$48.16', 'stock': 80}, 'settings': } ... 'django.conf.global_settings': , ... }
```

6. Study the ``settings`` object in the Django documentation and notice that it contains a [SECRET_KEY](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#secret-key) property, which has dangerous security implications if known to an attacker.
7. In the template, remove the ``{% debug %}`` statement and enter the expression 

```text
{{settings.SECRET_KEY}}
```

Results:

```text
ldbmb3c6b13x7kxiat3msfe92ycg761d
```

8. Save the template to output the framework's secret key.
9. Click the "Submit solution" button and submit the secret key to solve the lab.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to steal and submit the framework's secret key.
