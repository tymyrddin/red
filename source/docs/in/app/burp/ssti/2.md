# Basic server-side template injection (code context)

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection/exploiting/lab-server-side-template-injection-basic-code-context) is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the way it unsafely uses a Tornado template. To solve the lab, review the Tornado documentation to discover how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Log in as `wiener:peter` and while proxying traffic through Burp, log in and post a comment on one of the blog posts.
2. Notice that on the **My account** page, you can select whether you want the site to use your full name, first name, or nickname.

When you submit your choice, a ``POST`` request sets the value of the parameter ``blog-post-author-display`` to either ``user.name``, ``user.first_name``, or ``user.nickname``. When you load the page containing your comment, the name above your comment is updated based on the current value of this parameter.

3. In Burp, go to **Proxy" > "HTTP history** and find the request that sets this parameter, namely ``POST /my-account/change-blog-post-author-display``, and send it to Burp Repeater.
4. Study the [Tornado documentation](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/template.html) to discover that template expressions are surrounded with double curly braces, such as ``{{someExpression}}``. In Burp Repeater, notice that you can escape out of the expression and inject arbitrary template syntax as follows:

```text
blog-post-author-display=user.name}}{{7*7}}
```

5. Reload the page containing your test comment. Notice that the username now says ``Peter Wiener49}}``, indicating that a server-side template injection vulnerability may exist in the code context.

6. In the Tornado documentation, identify the syntax for executing arbitrary Python:

```text
{% somePython %}
```

7. Study the Python documentation to discover that by importing the ``os`` module, you can use the ``system()`` method to execute arbitrary system commands.
8. Combine this knowledge to construct a payload that deletes Carlos's file:

```text
{% import os %}
{{os.system('rm /home/carlos/morale.txt')
```

9. In Burp Repeater, go back to ``POST /my-account/change-blog-post-author-display``. Break out of the expression, and inject your payload into the parameter, remembering to URL-encode it as follows:

```text
blog-post-author-display=user.name}}{%25+import+os+%25}{{os.system('rm%20/home/carlos/morale.txt')
```

10. Reload the page containing your comment to execute the template and solve the lab.


## Exploitability

An attacker will need to review the Tornado documentation to discover how to execute arbitrary code, then log in and delete the `morale.txt` file from Carlos's home directory.
