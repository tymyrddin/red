# SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter) has a vulnerable stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Visit a product, click **Check stock**, intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
2. Change the URL in the ``stockApi`` parameter to ``http://127.0.0.1/`` and observe that the request is blocked.
3. Bypass the block by changing the URL to: ``http://127.1/``
4. Change the URL to ``http://127.1/admin`` and observe that the URL is blocked again.
5. Obfuscate the `a` in `admin` by double-URL encoding it to ``%2561`` to access the admin interface and delete the target user.

## Exploitability

An attacker will need to change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user `carlos`. The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that the attacker will need to bypass.
