# Exploiting XXE using external entities to retrieve files

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/lab-exploiting-xxe-to-retrieve-files) has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input and returns any unexpected values in the response.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Visit a product page, click **Check stock**, and intercept the resulting POST request in Burp Suite.
2. Send to Repeater. Insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the `stockCheck` element:

```text
<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
```

3. Replace the ``productId`` number with a reference to the external entity: ``&xxe;``.

## Exploitability

An attacker only needs to inject an XML external entity to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
