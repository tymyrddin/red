# Exploiting XInclude to retrieve files

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/lab-xinclude-attack) has a "Check stock" feature that embeds the user input inside a server-side XML document that is subsequently parsed. Because you don't control the entire XML document you can't define a DTD to launch a classic XXE attack.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Visit a product page, click **Check stock**, and intercept the resulting POST request in Burp Suite.
2. Set the value of the ``productId`` parameter to:

```text
<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>
```

3. Send:

![XXE](/_static/images/xxe14.png)

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to inject an `XInclude` statement to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
