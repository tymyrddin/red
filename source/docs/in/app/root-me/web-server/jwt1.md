# JWT Introduction

[root-me challenge: JWT - Introduction](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/JWT-Introduction): To validate the challenge, connect as admin.

Log in as guest, change the first two parts of the JWT token (`none` and `admin`), and connect as `admin` instead of `guest`.
