Root-me: Orchard foraging
===============================================================

Welcome to Root-Me’s tangled groves—where web apps dangle like overripe fruit, each one begging to be plucked,
squeezed, and juiced for flags. These challenges aren’t just vulnerable; they’re a masterclass in digital botany,
where XSS blooms like mold on forgotten apples, SQLi worms tunnel through the pulp of poorly pruned queries, and
authentication bugs rot the tree from the roots up. Every branch (challenge) is a lesson: sometimes the sweetest
fruit hangs lowest (hello, admin:admin), and sometimes you are just one prototype pollution beetle away from
collapsing the whole canopy.
