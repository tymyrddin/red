Petals and pentesting priorities
=========================================

In the orchard of security assessments, not all fruit rots equally. Some vulnerabilities hang low and ripe, ready to
be plucked with minimal effort, while others lurk deeper in the foliage, requiring patience and precision to exploit.
Prioritised vulnerability tables act as your harvest guide—pointing you to the most succulent flaws first—while
tailored vulnerability tables ensure you’re not just shaking random branches, but strategically targeting the sweetest,
most destructive finds.
