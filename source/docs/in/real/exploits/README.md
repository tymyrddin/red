# Assessing Physical Security Through Controlled Testing

Physical breaches remain one of the most overlooked threats in cybersecurity. By simulating real-world intrusion 
attempts—tailgating, badge cloning, or social engineering—we expose gaps in access control, surveillance, and 
employee awareness. Unlike digital attacks, physical intrusions leave no logs or alerts, making them dangerously 
effective. Proper testing identifies weak points before malicious actors exploit them, ensuring that security 
policies translate into real-world protection.
