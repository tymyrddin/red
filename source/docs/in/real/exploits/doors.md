# Getting through doors without a badge

Let’s face it—most secure doors are only as strong as the politeness of the person entering before you. Piggybacking 
(when someone holds the door for you) and tailgating (when you slip in behind them) work shockingly well because 
humans are hardwired to avoid awkwardness. A clipboard, a confident stride, and maybe a muttered "Thanks, boss" 
can get you into places you definitely shouldn’t be. Bonus points if you carry a fake plant—nobody questions the 
guy bringing "urgent office decor" into the server room. Or ...

## The "Pizza Delivery" Gambit

How: Walk in carrying a pizza box (empty or real) and say, "Delivery for the third floor!"

Why It Works: Nobody stops the pizza guy—hunger beats security awareness.

Bonus: Works even better if you wear a cap and say "Someone ordered 10 large pepperonis?"

## The "Fake Fire Drill"

How: Yell "Fire alarm test—everyone out!" and slip in while people exit.

Why It Works: Panic overrides skepticism.

Pro Tip: Works best in large offices where not everyone knows each other.

## The "Maintenance Worker" Disguise

How: Wear a high-vis vest, carry a ladder/toolbox, and look annoyed.

Why It Works: People assume you’re fixing something—no questions asked.

Extra: Mumble "Faulty wiring on floor 2" if challenged.

## The "Lost & Confused Visitor"

How: Look at your phone, sigh loudly, and ask, "Where’s the HR interview room?"

Why It Works: People love to help—and escort you inside.

Bonus: Works even better if you carry a résumé folder.

## The "Wi-Fi Signal Chase"

How: Hold a phone/laptop like you’re tracking a signal, muttering "The dead zone is here somewhere…"

Why It Works: Tech-looking behaviour = instant credibility.

Pro Move: Wear a lanyard with a fake tech company logo.

## The "Fake Cleaner"

How: Push a janitor’s cart (or just carry a spray bottle and rag).

Why It Works: Invisible workforce syndrome—nobody notices cleaners.

Extra: Bonus points if you actually wipe something while passing.

## The "Bathroom Emergency"

How: Rush in clutching your stomach, gasping "Where’s the restroom?!"

Why It Works: Humanity > security policies.

Caution: Don’t overact—subtle desperation sells it.

## The "Contractor Swipe"

How: Wait near the door for an employee, then say "Can you badge me in? I’m with IT."

Why It Works: Fear of delaying "important" work makes people comply.

Key: Use jargon like "VPN tunnel issues" to sound legit.

## The "Fake Package"

How: Carry a bulky box labeled "Fragile—Confidential" and struggle with the door.

Why It Works: People instinctively help with heavy items.

Pro Tip: Add a fake logistics company logo for extra believability.

## The "Reverse Psychology Exit"

How: Stand inside the door looking frustrated, then walk out—but quickly pivot back in as someone enters.

Why It Works: People assume you just had badge trouble.
