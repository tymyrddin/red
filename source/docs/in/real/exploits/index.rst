The art of looking like you belong
========================================================

If James Bond worked in cybersecurity, he wouldn’t bother with hacking—he’d just walk in with a clipboard and a
confident nod. Physical security testing is all about acting first, apologizing never. Can you slip through doors
behind an employee? Clone a badge with a 10 € RFID reader? Sneak into a restricted area by just walking fast?
The answer is usually "yes," because most people assume if you’re inside the building, you’re supposed to be there.
Bonus points if you bring a ladder—nobody questions a person with a ladder.
