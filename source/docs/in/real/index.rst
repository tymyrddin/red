Hack the planet? Nah, just hold the door for me
=================================================

Why hack a firewall when you can just walk in behind someone carrying coffee? From tailgating like a subway surfer to
cloning badges faster than a bored intern copies spreadsheets, physical breaches thrive on one universal truth: humans
would rather avoid awkwardness than challenge a stranger with a clipboard. The best part? Half these tricks work better
if you look like you don’t belong—because nothing screams "legitimate employee" like a person in socks and sandals
muttering about Wi-Fi signals.Welcome to the Red Team
