Assessing the human firewall
==================================================

Social engineering is the cybersecurity equivalent of convincing someone to hold your beer while you pick their pocket.
It is not about fancy exploits—it’s about asking the right questions with enough confidence that people forget you
should not be asking them. Whether you’re sweet-talking your way past security guards or "accidentally" dropping
malware-laden USB drives in the parking lot, the goal is simple: make human nature work for you, not against you.
Just remember—if you get caught, "I am from IT" only works until someone checks your badge.
