# Assessing the Human Firewall

Social engineering tests an organization’s most unpredictable vulnerability: people. By simulating real-world 
manipulation tactics—phishing, pretexting, or physical intrusion—we expose gaps in security awareness and operational 
procedures. The goal isn’t just to trick employees but to identify systemic weaknesses in training, policies, 
and response protocols. When technical defenses are strong, human error often becomes the easiest attack vector—and 
the most dangerous to ignore.
