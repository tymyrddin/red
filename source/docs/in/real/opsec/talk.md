## Attack tree

```text
1 Use social engineering tactics commonly used in interrogations for conversations
    1.1 Build rapport early in the engagement in order to gain trust and lower the subject's guard
    1.2 Show genuine interest
    1.3 Use mirroring a few words for gathering more information
    1.4 Use labelling to figure out what is going on without directly asking
```

## Notes

When interviewing or interrogating people, a number of physical reactions to questions can be
used to identify topic areas that should lead to more questioning.
