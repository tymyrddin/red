# The Spore-Thief's Grimoire

## What?

The sacred-dark art of exposing weaknesses in the mycelial tapestry:

I. The Threefold Path of Revelation

* Tracing the Mother-Root's Crooked Growth (Design flaws in the fungal network's core)
* Listening for Broken Mycelial Hymns (Implementation errors in spore channels)
* Marking the Withering Vein-Paths (Neglected maintenance of fungal highways)

II. Where the Grove Bleeds Sweetest

* Tangled Hyphal Knots (Misconfigured spore dispersal systems)
* The Honeycomb's Missing Walls (Faulty filtration membranes/firewalls)
* Elder Caps Gathering Mold (Aging fruiting bodies/outdated systems)
* Drunkard's Spore Channels (Unsecured nutrient exchange protocols)
* Moonlit Root-Bare Patches (Unnecessary exposed mycelial strands)

III. The Thief's Fivefold Methodology

* The Blind Hypha's Dance (Passive spore collection/recon)
* Tasting the Vein-Wine (Active probing of nutrient flows)
* Counting the Exposed Gills (Enumeration of fruiting bodies)
* The Rot's Whispered Map (Documenting vulnerable pathways)
* Blight's Shopping List (Prioritizing targets by sweetness)

IV. Omen Verses (Signs of Weakness)

* When the mycelium sings off-key (Service anomalies)
* Where the cap's underside shows bruising (Unpatched systems)
* When the earth coughs black dust (Security log alerts)

## Why?
