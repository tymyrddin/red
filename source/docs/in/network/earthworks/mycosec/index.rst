MycoSec Labs – Fungolia Red Team Consultancy
===============================================

Hidden in subterranean mycelium labs, MycoSec Labs pokes, prods, and plants simulated chaos in client networks—its
intentionally exposed environments perfect for Earthworks exercises.

Here, the descriptions are preparations, like tools laid out on the workbench. They do not come with guarantees and
will rarely work exactly as written—the soil shifts, the roots resist, and each network grows differently. Treat
this as a space for study, experimentation, and understanding, not a manual for live mischief.

Disclaimer: Do not execute these techniques against networks or systems without explicit permission. Improper use is illegal and dangerous.
