Openhands International – Fungolia branch
===============================================

Tucked into the fungal hills of Fungolia, OpenHands International tirelessly defends human rights—while its
labyrinthine network hums with dummy volunteer data, cloud tools, and IoT devices waiting to be explored.

Here, the descriptions are preparations, like tools laid out on the workbench. They do not come with guarantees and
will rarely work exactly as written—the soil shifts, the roots resist, and each network grows differently. Treat
this as a space for study, experimentation, and understanding, not a manual for live mischief.

Disclaimer: Do not execute these techniques against networks or systems without explicit permission. Improper use is illegal and dangerous.
