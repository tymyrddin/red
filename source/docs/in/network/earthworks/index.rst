Earthworks
==========================================================================

Beneath the visible canopy of the internet lies a tangled web of roots, veins, and hidden strata. Earthworks is your
map to those underground layers: a hands-on space where we explore how to trace, chain, and experiment with attacks
uncovered in the `Rootways of the World Tree <https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/in/network/roots/>`_ section.

Here, the descriptions are preparations, like tools laid out on the workbench. They do not come with guarantees and
will rarely work exactly as writtenâ€”the soil shifts, the roots resist, and each network grows differently. Treat
this as a space for study, experimentation, and understanding, not a manual for live mischief.

Disclaimer: Do not execute these techniques against networks or systems without explicit permission. Improper use is illegal and dangerous.
