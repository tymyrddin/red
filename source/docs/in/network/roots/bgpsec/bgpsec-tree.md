# Attack tree (BGPsec)

This attack tree explores the methods to undermine BGPsec, targeting its cryptographic core, trust infrastructure, and operational complexities. From exploiting algorithmic weaknesses and compromising key storage to leveraging partial adoption and AI-enhanced attacks, this framework reveals how the very mechanisms intended to secure global routing can be subverted to orchestrate sophisticated hijacks and undermine network trust at scale.
