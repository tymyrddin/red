# Resource exhaustion attacks

## Attack pattern

Resource exhaustion attacks against IPsec target the finite computational, memory, and state-tracking capabilities of implementations. By flooding systems with resource-intensive operations or crafting malicious inputs that consume disproportionate resources, attackers can cause denial of service, performance degradation, or bypass security controls. These attacks are particularly effective because they exploit the fundamental tension between cryptographic complexity and system resources.

## Why it works

-   Finite resources: IPsec devices have limited SA tables, CPU capacity, and memory for cryptographic operations.
-   Asymmetric cost: IKE negotiation is computationally expensive for responders compared to initiators.
-   Stateful nature: SA maintenance requires persistent memory allocation and state tracking.
-   Cryptographic complexity: Modern algorithms (PFS, large DH groups) significantly increase computational load.
-   Interoperability requirements: Support for various algorithms and configurations expands attack surface.
-   Silent degradation: Resource exhaustion may cause performance issues before complete failure.

## Mitigation

### SA resource management
-   Action: Implement strict SA quotas and state protection
-   How:
    -   Enforce maximum SA limits per peer and globally
    -   Implement aggressive half-open SA timeouts
    -   Use SA rate limiting and quotas
    -   Deploy SA garbage collection mechanisms
-   Configuration example (SA resource protection, cisco):

```text
crypto isakmp limit SA-LIMITS
 max-in-negotation-sa 100
 max-sa 5000
 percent 80
 queue-depth 1000
!
crypto ipsec sa limit 10000
```

### IKE flood protection
-   Action: Protect against IKE negotiation flooding
-   How:
    -   Implement IKE rate limiting per source IP
    -   Use puzzle mechanisms for IKE_SA_INIT requests
    -   Deploy SYN cookie-like techniques for half-open SAs
    -   Filter spoofed source addresses at network perimeter
-   Configuration example (IKE flood protection, junos):

```text
security {
    ike {
        traceoptions {
            flag flood;
        }
        flood-protection {
            threshold 100;
            source-limit 10;
            timeout 60;
        }
    }
}
```

### Computational load management
-   Action: Manage cryptographic processing loads
-   How:
    -   Implement algorithmic cost awareness in negotiations
    -   Use hardware crypto acceleration for expensive operations
    -   Deploy computational load shedding under stress
    -   Monitor CPU utilization and throttle expensive operations
-   Configuration example (CPU protection, strongswan):

```text
charon {
    # Computational load management
    load_balancing = yes
    load_balance_factor = 2.0
    # Hardware acceleration
    openssl {
        engines = af_alg
    }
}
```

### Memory protection mechanisms
-   Action: Prevent memory exhaustion through SA manipulation
-   How:
    -   Implement maximum memory limits per SA
    -   Use memory pooling for SA state allocation
    -   Deploy memory pressure detection and mitigation
    -   Monitor SA memory usage and enforce limits
-   Configuration example (Memory protection):

```bash
# Systemd memory limits for IKE daemon
[Service]
MemoryMax=512M
MemoryHigh=384M
CPUQuota=75%
TasksMax=1000
```

### Monitoring and alerting
-   Action: Detect and respond to resource exhaustion attempts
-   How:
    -   Monitor SA table utilization and growth rates
    -   Implement alerts for abnormal IKE negotiation rates
    -   Track cryptographic processing load patterns
    -   Monitor memory usage per SA and globally
-   Configuration example (Monitoring setup):

```bash
# IPsec resource monitoring script
watch -n 30 'ipsec statusall | grep -E "(SAs|memory|CPU)" \
&& cat /proc/net/xfrm_stat \
&& netstat -s | grep -i "retransmit\|timeout"'
```

## Key insights from real-world implementations

-   Scale limitations: Many commercial devices have surprisingly low SA capacity limits.
-   Asymmetric impact: Responders bear significantly higher computational loads than initiators.
-   Hardware dependencies: Performance varies dramatically based on crypto acceleration capabilities.
-   Configuration drift: Default settings often prioritize performance over security against exhaustion attacks.

## Future trends and recommendations

-   Adaptive resource management: AI-driven resource allocation that can detect and mitigate exhaustion attacks.
-   Hardware acceleration: Increased use of dedicated crypto processors to handle computational loads.
-   Cloud-scale architectures: Distributed SA state management across multiple nodes.
-   Zero-trust resource allocation: Treat all resource requests as potentially malicious until validated.

## Conclusion

Resource exhaustion attacks pose a significant threat to IPsec implementations by targeting the fundamental limitations of cryptographic processing and state management. These attacks can cause denial of service, performance degradation, and potentially bypass security controls by overwhelming system resources. Defence requires comprehensive resource management including strict quotas, rate limiting, computational load awareness, and continuous monitoring. As cryptographic requirements evolve toward more computationally intensive algorithms, organizations must implement robust resource protection mechanisms and ensure their IPsec infrastructure can withstand determined exhaustion attacks while maintaining legitimate service availability.
