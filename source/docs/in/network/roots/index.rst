Rootways of the World Tree (@Internet)
=========================================

In the intricate network of the internet, BGP and MP-BGP serve as the deep-rooted pathways, connecting diverse
networks across the digital landscape. These protocols, while essential for data routing, are susceptible to various
vulnerabilities. Through direct manipulations like prefix hijacking and indirect exploits via other protocols, these
roots can be compromised, leading to potential disruptions.
