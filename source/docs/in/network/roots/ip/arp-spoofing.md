# ARP apoofing/poisoning (IPv4)

## Attack pattern

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a stateless protocol used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network segment (Layer 2). ARP spoofing (or poisoning) is a technique where an attacker sends forged ARP messages onto a LAN to manipulate the ARP caches of other devices. This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or block network traffic.

## Why it works

-   Stateless Protocol: ARP has no authentication mechanism. Devices inherently trust ARP responses without verifying their legitimacy.
-   Broadcast Nature: ARP requests are broadcast to all devices on the local network, making it easy for attackers to monitor and respond to requests.
-   Cache Updates: Most systems automatically update their ARP cache with the latest ARP response, regardless of whether they requested it (gratuitous ARP).
-   Protocol Simplicity: The simplicity of ARP makes it vulnerable to exploitation, as there are no built-in security features.
-   Layer 2 Attacks: ARP attacks occur at the data link layer, making them invisible to traditional IP-based security measures.

## Mitigation

### Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI)
-   Action: Deploy DAI on managed switches to validate ARP packets.
-   How:
    -   Cisco Switches:
        -   Enable DHCP snooping to build a trusted database of IP-MAC bindings.
        -   Configure DAI on VLANs: `ip arp inspection vlan [vlan-id]`
        -   Set trusted interfaces: `ip arp inspection trust` on uplinks and authorized DHCP servers.
        -   Rate-limit ARP packets on untrusted ports: `ip arp inspection limit rate [pps]`
    -   Other Platforms: Similar features exist on Aruba (ACL), Juniper (ARP guardian), and other enterprise switches.

### Static ARP entries
-   Action: Manually configure static ARP entries for critical infrastructure.
-   How:
    -   Windows: `arp -s [ip-address] [mac-address]`
    -   Linux: `arp -i [interface] -s [ip-address] [mac-address]`
    -   Network Devices: Configure static ARP entries on routers and switches for servers and gateways.
-   Limitation: Not scalable for large networks; best for critical devices only.

### Encryption
-   Action: Implement encryption to protect data confidentiality even if intercepted.
-   How:
    -   Transport Layer: Enforce HTTPS (TLS), SSH, and SFTP for all communications.
    -   Network Layer: Deploy IPsec VPNs for site-to-site and remote access communications.
    -   Application Layer: Use end-to-end encryption for sensitive applications.

### Network segmentation
-   Action: Reduce the attack surface by dividing the network into smaller segments.
-   How:
    -   VLANs: Implement VLANs to isolate departments, guests, and critical systems.
    -   Private VLANs (PVLANs): Use PVLANs to restrict communication between hosts within the same segment.
    -   Microsegmentation: Implement software-defined networking (SDN) or zero-trust architectures for granular control.

### ARP security software
-   Action: Use host-based ARP protection tools.
-   How:
    -   Windows: Tools like ARPWatch, XArp, or built-in network protection features.
    -   Linux: arpwatch, arpalert, or iptables rules to filter ARP traffic.
    -   Endpoint Protection: Modern EDR solutions often include ARP spoofing detection.

### Monitoring and detection
-   Action: Implement continuous monitoring for ARP anomalies.
-   How:
    -   IDS/IPS: Deploy network intrusion detection systems with ARP spoofing signatures.
    -   SIEM: Correlate events from switches, servers, and security tools to detect anomalies.
    -   Network Traffic Analysis: Use tools like Zeek, Suricata, or commercial NTA solutions to baseline normal ARP traffic.

### Physical security
-   Action: Secure physical access to network infrastructure.
-   How:
    -   Switch Port Security: Implement features like MAC address limiting, sticky MAC, and port security.
    -   802.1X: Deploy port-based network access control (NAC) to authenticate devices before granting network access.
    -   Physical Controls: Secure wiring closets and network equipment rooms.
