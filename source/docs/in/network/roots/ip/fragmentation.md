# IP fragmentation (IPv4)

## Attack pattern

An attacker deliberately crafts IP packets that are fragmented in an abnormal or malicious way. These packets are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the target system's algorithm for reassembling fragments into a complete packet. The goals are:

1. System Crashes & Kernel Panics: By sending overlapping fragments (e.g., two fragments that write to the same memory location during reassembly) or extremely large fragments, the attacker can cause buffer overflows or logical errors in the IP stack, crashing the device.
2. Evasion of Security Controls: Many firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) perform initial inspection on the first fragment but may not have the capability or resources to fully reassemble all fragments before inspection. An attacker can hide malicious payload in subsequent fragments to bypass these controls.
3. Resource Exhaustion: Flooding a target with a high volume of fragments forces it to allocate memory and CPU cycles to reassembly, potentially exhausting resources and causing a Denial-of-Service (DoS) for legitimate traffic.

## Why it works

-   Legacy Code & Embedded Systems: Many older operating systems and countless IoT devices run on outdated kernels with known, unpatched fragmentation reassembly vulnerabilities.
-   Performance vs. Security Trade-off: Fully reassembling every packet flow is computationally expensive. Network middleboxes (firewalls, IPS) may skip deep inspection of fragments to maintain throughput, creating a blind spot.
-   Protocol Complexity: The IP specification allows for fragmentation, and handling all edge cases correctly (e.g., non-zero fragment offsets, inconsistent sizes) is difficult, leading to implementation flaws.

## Mitigation

### Patching

-   Action: Establish a rigorous patch management program.
-   How: Subscribe to security mailing lists (e.g., CERT, vendor advisories) for all network devices (routers, firewalls), servers, and IoT device firmware. Prioritize and apply patches for vulnerabilities identified by CVEs related to "IP fragmentation," "Teardrop," or "Ping of Death."
-   Example: Regularly update Linux kernels on servers to incorporate the latest security fixes for the `net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c` module.

### Firewall configuration

-   Action: Configure firewalls to be fragmentation-aware.
-   How:
    -   Cisco ASA/Firepower: Use the `fragment` command to set chain limits and timeouts. Enable settings to "Reassemble before inspection."
    -   iptables (Linux): Use rules to drop suspicious fragments.
        -   `iptables -A INPUT -f -j DROP` drops all fragmented packets (aggressive, may break legitimate traffic).
        -   A more nuanced approach: Use the `u32` module to check for malicious fragment offsets.
    -   Palo Alto Networks: Ensure the security policy has "Decrypt and reassemble fragments for inspection" enabled in the rule's profile.
    -   General Best Practice: Where possible, outright block all fragmented packets at the internet edge. Modern protocols like TCP and HTTP/2 are designed to avoid fragmentation. If fragmentation is necessary for legitimate internal applications, only allow it from trusted sources.

### Kernel hardening

-   Action: Tune operating system parameters to limit the impact of a fragmentation flood.
-   How (Linux Specific):
    -   Reduce Reassembly Buffer Size: Lowering the maximum memory allocated for reassembly makes the system more resilient to exhaustion attacks.
        -   `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh=262144` (sets a lower maximum memory threshold)
        -   `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_time=15` (reduces the time window for reassembling a packet)
    -   Make Changes Permanent: Add these lines to `/etc/sysctl.conf`.
-   Note: Test these changes in a non-production environment first, as they may impact the performance of legitimate applications that rely on fragmentation.

### Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)

-   Action: Deploy and tune IPS signatures specifically for fragmentation attacks.
-   How:
    -   Snort/Suricata: Enable and test rules within categories like `protocol-ip-fragmentation` and `protocol-ip-bad-frags`. Examples include detecting packets with the "More Fragments" flag set but a zero offset, or overlapping fragments.
    -   Commercial IPS (e.g., Sourcefire, Check Point): Ensure the IPS policy is configured to perform "stream reassembly" and has signatures for fragmentation evasion techniques enabled and set to a blocking mode.
    -   Tuning: Regularly review IPS logs for false positives related to fragmentation rules to ensure legitimate traffic is not disrupted.
