# BGP and DNS infrastructure attacks

## Attack pattern

BGP and DNS infrastructure attacks represent a critical threat vector that targets the fundamental systems responsible for internet routing and name resolution. These attacks exploit the interdependence between these two core protocols to disrupt services, intercept traffic, or redirect users to malicious destinations. By manipulating either BGP routing or DNS resolution, attackers can cause widespread internet disruptions, facilitate espionage, or enable financial fraud .

## Why it works

-   Protocol interdependence: BGP and DNS are fundamentally interconnectedâ€”DNS provides name-to-IP resolution while BGP determines how to reach those IP addresses, creating multiple points of potential failure when attacked in combination .
-   Trust-based operations: Both protocols historically operate on a trust model where participants are assumed to be legitimate, making authentication and validation optional rather than mandatory .
-   Implementation complexity: The complexity of both protocols leads to implementation inconsistencies and vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit .
-   Partial security deployment: Security extensions like DNSSEC and RPKI are not universally deployed, creating security gaps that attackers can exploit .
-   Monitoring challenges: Detecting sophisticated attacks that span both protocols requires coordinated monitoring that many organizations lack .
-   Economic factors: The economic impact of successful attacks creates financial incentives for attackers while the cost of comprehensive protection deter defenders .

## Mitigation

### BGP security hardening
-   Action: Implement comprehensive BGP security measures
-   How:
    -   Deploy RPKI for route origin validation to prevent route hijacking 
    -   Implement BGPsec for path validation where supported
    -   Use route filtering based on Internet Routing Registries
-   Configuration example (cisco):

```text
router bgp 65001
 bgp rpki server tcp 203.0.113.1 port 323
 address-family ipv4
  bgp rpki origin-as validation
```

### DNS security measures
-   Action: Enhance DNS security across all infrastructure
-   How:
    -   Implement DNSSEC for all authoritative zones
    -   Use DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS for secure transport
    -   Deploy response rate limiting and query filtering
-   Best practice: Regular DNSSEC validation monitoring and key management

### Monitoring and detection
-   Action: Implement comprehensive monitoring for both protocols
-   How:
    -   Deploy BGP monitoring tools (BGPStream, RIPE Stat)
    -   Implement DNS query monitoring and anomaly detection
    -   Set up coordinated alerting for cross-protocol attacks 
-   Tools: Use integrated security information and event management systems

### Infrastructure redundancy
-   Action: Build resilient infrastructure designs
-   How:
    -   Implement anycast DNS with diverse transit providers
    -   Use multi-homed BGP configurations with diverse paths
    -   Deploy secondary DNS authorities in geographically dispersed locations
-   Best practice: Regular failover testing and disaster recovery drills

### Access control and authentication
-   Action: Strengthen access controls for critical infrastructure
-   How:
    -   Implement strict access controls for BGP and DNS management interfaces
    -   Use multi-factor authentication for all administrative access
    -   Regularly review and audit access permissions
-   Configuration example: Role-based access control for network operations

### Incident response planning
-   Action: Develop and maintain cross-protocol incident response procedures
-   How:
    -   Create playbooks for BGP and DNS incident response
    -   Establish communication protocols with upstream providers and peers
    -   Conduct regular tabletop exercises for combined scenarios 
-   Documentation: Maintain updated contact lists and escalation procedures

### Protocol security extensions
-   Action: Deploy and enforce security extensions for both protocols
-   How:
    -   Mandate RPKI validation for all BGP peers
    -   Require DNSSEC validation for all DNS resolution
    -   Implement TLS for all management and protocol communications
-   Best practice: Gradual deployment with careful testing and monitoring

## Key insights from real-world incidents

-   YouTube Pakistan incident: Demonstrated how BGP hijacking could be used for censorship but inadvertently caused global outages due to the interdependence of BGP and DNS systems .
-   Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 outage: Showed how internal configuration errors could cause global DNS outages and how BGP hijackers quickly exploit such situations .
-   Cryptocurrency exchange attacks: Highlighted how attackers combine BGP hijacking with DNS manipulation to steal funds from users .

## Future trends and recommendations

-   Automated defense systems: Development of AI-driven systems that can detect and mitigate combined BGP-DNS attacks in real-time .
-   Protocol enhancements: Continued development of security extensions for both protocols and pressure for universal adoption.
-   Global cooperation: Enhanced international cooperation on routing security and incident response .
-   Zero trust architectures: Implementation of zero trust principles for network infrastructure to limit attack propagation.

## Conclusion

BGP and DNS infrastructure attacks represent a severe threat to internet stability by targeting the fundamental protocols that enable network routing and name resolution. These attacks exploit the interdependence between BGP and DNS, protocol complexities, implementation vulnerabilities, and inconsistent security deployment. Comprehensive mitigation requires a multi-layered approach including protocol security extensions, infrastructure hardening, comprehensive monitoring, and coordinated incident response planning. As attacks continue to evolve in sophistication, maintaining robust security practices for both BGP and DNS infrastructure remains essential for protecting global internet connectivity.
