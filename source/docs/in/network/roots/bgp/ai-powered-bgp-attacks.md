# AI-powered BGP attacks

## Attack Pattern

AI-powered BGP attacks represent an emerging threat category where artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are weaponised to enhance the scale, sophistication, and evasion capabilities of Border Gateway Protocol attacks. These attacks leverage AI's pattern recognition, optimisation capabilities, and adaptive learning to overcome traditional defence mechanisms, coordinate complex multi-vector attacks, and maintain persistence in target networks. The integration of AI enables attacks that are more targeted, evasive, and difficult to attribute than conventional BGP manipulation techniques .
