# AI-powered BGP attacks

## Attack pattern

AI-powered BGP attacks represent an emerging threat category where artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are weaponised to enhance the scale, sophistication, and evasion capabilities of Border Gateway Protocol attacks. These attacks leverage AI's pattern recognition, optimisation capabilities, and adaptive learning to overcome traditional defence mechanisms, coordinate complex multi-vector attacks, and maintain persistence in target networks. The integration of AI enables attacks that are more targeted, evasive, and difficult to attribute than conventional BGP manipulation techniques

## Why it works

-   Pattern recognition superiority: AI systems can identify subtle patterns in network behaviour and defence systems that humans might miss, enabling more effective attack strategies.
-   Adaptive learning capabilities: Machine learning systems can continuously adapt to defence measures, evolving attack strategies in real-time to bypass security controls.
-   Optimisation efficiency: AI algorithms can optimise attack parameters (timing, scale, duration) to maximise impact while minimising detection probability.
-   Coordination at scale: Autonomous systems can coordinate complex attacks across multiple networks and jurisdictions simultaneously, something difficult for human operators.
-   Speed of execution: AI systems can execute attacks at machine speeds, far exceeding human response times for defence and mitigation.
-   Evasion sophistication: Advanced AI can generate attacks that appear legitimate to both human operators and automated defence systems.
