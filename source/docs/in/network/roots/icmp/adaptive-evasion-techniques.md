# Adaptive evasion techniques

## Attack pattern

Adaptive evasion techniques represent the cutting edge of network-based attack methodology, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to dynamically modify attack patterns in real-time. These techniques enable sophisticated threat actors to bypass traditional security controls, evade detection systems, and maintain persistent access by mimicking legitimate network behaviour and adapting to defensive measures.
