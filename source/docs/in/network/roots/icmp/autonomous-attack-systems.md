Defence against these advanced threats requires equally sophisticated approaches, including AI-powered security systems, enhanced behavioural analysis, comprehensive network segmentation, and automated response capabilities. As the threat landscape continues to evolve toward greater autonomy, organisations must invest in next-generation security measures that can anticipate, detect, and respond to these intelligent threats in real-time. The future of cybersecurity will be defined by the competition between autonomous attack and defence systems, requiring continuous innovation and adaptation in defensive strategies.
