# Forensic evasion techniques

## Attack pattern

Forensic evasion techniques represent sophisticated methods used by threat actors to obstruct, mislead, or eliminate digital forensic investigations. These approaches target the entire investigative lifecycle, from evidence collection and preservation to analysis and attribution, leveraging ICMP protocols to create plausible deniability and complicate post-incident investigations.

## Conclusion

Forensic evasion techniques represent a critical challenge in modern cybersecurity investigations, enabling threat actors to obstruct, mislead, or eliminate evidence of their activities. These methods leverage the fundamental necessity of ICMP protocols while exploiting the complexities and limitations of digital forensic investigations. Defence against these techniques requires a comprehensive approach including robust logging, forensic readiness planning, advanced detection capabilities, infrastructure hardening, and international cooperation. As evasion techniques continue to evolve in sophistication, organisations must prioritise forensic preparedness and implement measures to protect the integrity of digital evidence. The future of digital investigations will depend on maintaining the ability to conduct effective forensic analysis despite increasingly sophisticated evasion efforts, requiring ongoing adaptation and investment in forensic capabilities.
