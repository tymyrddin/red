Domain Name System (DNS)
=========================================

The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the fundamental phonebook of the internet, translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. This critical yet often trust-based infrastructure presents a vast and complex attack surface. From its core protocol mechanics to modern encrypted iterations (DoH, DoT, DoQ) and its deep integration with cloud and supply chain ecosystems, DNS is a prime target for exploitation.

-----------------------------------------
An attack tree is structural, not operational. It exists in the comfortable world of pure logic, where things
either work or they don't, gates either open or stay closed, and time is merely a dimension I/you/we draw an arrow along.

It's comprehensive. It has branches for sub-prefix hijacking, exact-prefix hijacking, squatting attacks, path
manipulation, and several dozen other variations. Each node connects logically to its children. The structure is clean.

Until someone takes a tree seriously enough to ask `but what would this actually *look* like? <https://purple.tymyrddin.dev/docs/lantern/red-lanterns/playbooks/>`_
