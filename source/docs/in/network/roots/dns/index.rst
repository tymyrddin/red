Domain Name System (DNS)
=========================================

The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the fundamental phonebook of the internet, translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. This critical yet often trust-based infrastructure presents a vast and complex attack surface. From its core protocol mechanics to modern encrypted iterations (DoH, DoT, DoQ) and its deep integration with cloud and supply chain ecosystems, DNS is a prime target for exploitation.
