# Network infrastructure attacks

## Attack pattern

Network infrastructure attacks target the physical and logical components forming the backbone of internet routing systems. These attacks focus on internet exchange points, route servers, management interfaces, and supporting systems that enable BGP operations. By compromising critical infrastructure elements, adversaries can achieve widespread impact on routing integrity, traffic flow, and network stability across multiple autonomous systems.

## Why it works

* Centralised infrastructure: Internet exchange points and route servers represent concentrated points of failure
* Management complexity: Large networks have numerous management interfaces and access points
* Legacy systems: Critical infrastructure often runs on outdated systems with known vulnerabilities
* Physical access requirements: Physical security measures may be inadequate or inconsistently applied
* Supply chain trust: Global supply chains introduce multiple points of potential compromise
* Operational transparency: Monitoring and management systems require exposure that can be exploited
* Configuration complexity: Complex network configurations often contain security oversights

## Key insights from real-world implementations

* Concentrated risk: Internet exchange points represent significant concentration of routing risk
* Management interface exposure: Many attacks originate through compromised management systems
* Physical security gaps: Physical access controls are often weaker than network security measures
* Supply chain transparency: Limited visibility into equipment supply chains creates security risks
* Operational complexity: Large networks struggle with consistent security implementation

## Future trends and recommendations

* Zero trust architecture: Implementation of zero trust principles for network infrastructure
* Automated security compliance: Development of automated security policy enforcement
* Enhanced monitoring: Advanced analytics and machine learning for threat detection
* Supply chain verification: Improved methods for equipment authenticity verification
* Cross-organisational collaboration: Enhanced sharing of security best practices and threat intelligence

## Conclusion

Network infrastructure attacks pose a severe threat to the stability and security of global internet routing. These attacks target critical components including internet exchange points, route servers, management interfaces, and physical infrastructure. Comprehensive mitigation requires a multi-layered approach encompassing technical controls, physical security measures, supply chain verification, and continuous monitoring. As attacks become increasingly sophisticated, organisations must prioritise infrastructure security through rigorous access controls, regular security assessments, and implementation of defence-in-depth strategies. The protection of critical networking infrastructure demands ongoing investment, vigilance, and collaboration across the internet community to ensure the continued reliability and security of global routing systems.
