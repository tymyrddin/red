# BGP session manipulation

## Attack pattern

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session manipulation attacks target the establishment, maintenance, and termination of BGP peer relationships. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP-based session management of BGP to disrupt routing infrastructure, inject malicious routes, or compromise network stability. By manipulating BGP sessions, adversaries can cause widespread network disruption, traffic interception, or route poisoning across autonomous systems.

## Why it works

-   Protocol Reliability Dependence: BGP relies on TCP for reliable delivery, creating a dependency that attackers can exploit
-   Predictable Behaviour: BGP implementations often exhibit predictable responses to session manipulation attempts
-   Authentication Limitations: MD5 authentication provides insufficient protection against determined attackers
-   State Complexity: Complex BGP finite state machines contain numerous edge cases and potential vulnerabilities
-   Interoperability Requirements: Support for various BGP implementations forces tolerance of non-standard behaviour
-   Legacy Deployments: Many networks operate with outdated BGP implementations containing known vulnerabilities

## Conclusion

BGP session manipulation attacks represent a significant threat to internet routing infrastructure. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in session establishment, maintenance, and termination processes to disrupt network operations, inject malicious routes, or compromise network stability. Comprehensive mitigation requires a multi-layered approach including enhanced authentication, session protection mechanisms, sequence number security, and continuous monitoring. As BGP continues to form the backbone of internet routing, organisations must implement robust session security measures, maintain vigilant monitoring, and participate in industry-wide efforts to improve BGP security standards and implementations.
