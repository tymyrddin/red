# Protocol-level TCP attacks

## Attack pattern

Protocol-level TCP attacks target the fundamental mechanisms of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that underpin BGP sessions. These attacks exploit inherent vulnerabilities in TCP's design, implementation flaws in router operating systems, and weaknesses in how BGP utilises TCP for reliable communication. By manipulating TCP's core protocols, attackers can disrupt BGP sessions, inject malicious content, or exhaust router resources.

## Why it works

-   Protocol design limitations: TCP's design includes inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited
-   Implementation variability: Different TCP stack implementations have unique weaknesses
-   Predictable behaviour: TCP protocols often exhibit predictable patterns that attackers can analyse
-   Resource constraints: Network devices have limited resources for handling TCP connections
-   Stateful complexity: Maintaining TCP state requires significant resources and complex logic
-   Interoperability requirements: Support for various TCP extensions increases attack surface
-   Legacy compatibility: Backward compatibility requirements prevent removal of vulnerable features

## Conclusion

Protocol-level TCP attacks represent a significant threat to BGP infrastructure and network stability. These attacks exploit fundamental aspects of TCP's design and implementation to disrupt communications, exhaust resources, and compromise session integrity. Comprehensive mitigation requires a multi-layered approach including TCP stack hardening, rate limiting, sequence number protection, resource management, and continuous monitoring. As network infrastructure evolves, organisations must maintain vigilance against TCP-level attacks through regular security assessments, prompt patching of vulnerabilities, and implementation of defence-in-depth strategies. The complexity of TCP protocol attacks necessitates ongoing research, development of new protection mechanisms, and collaboration across the networking community to enhance overall security posture.
