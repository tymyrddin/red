# Installing the RIPE labs environment on Linux

The labs for this course run inside a virtual machine. You only need to install this environment once. Once installed, you can start and stop the labs through your terminal, and access them via your web browser.

## What do you need?

Make sure your computer meets these requirements:

* Linux computer
* At least 10 GB of free hard disk space
* At least 2 GB of RAM
* About 30 minutes of time
* Good Internet connectivity

The lab environment is built on VirtualBox (for running virtual machines) and Vagrant (for managing virtual machines 
and configuration). Both are free and open-source. And clash, so read 
[Two hypervisors will walk into a kernel](switch.md) first.

## Installing VirtualBox and Vagrant

VirtualBox is available in Ubuntu repositories, but often behind the latest release. Using the repository version is 
usually safe, but kernel module compilation may require:

```bash
sudo apt install dkms build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

For the latest VirtualBox version, the simplest way without fighting the repository rotating keys shit is to download 
the `.deb` directly instead of using the VirtualBox repo:

```bash
# Download VirtualBox 7.2 directly
wget https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.2.0/virtualbox-7.2_7.2.0-170228~Ubuntu~noble_amd64.deb

# Install it
sudo dpkg -i virtualbox-7.2_7.2.0-170228~Ubuntu~noble_amd64.deb
Unpacking virtualbox-7.2 (7.2.0-170228~Ubuntu~noble) ...

# Fix any missing dependencies
sudo apt install -f
```

Vagrant may be available in the Ubuntu repository, but can be outdated. Get the `.deb` from the [Vagrant official downloads](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and install, or `wget` it on the command-line and install:

```bash
wget -O - https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(grep -oP '(?<=UBUNTU_CODENAME=).*' /etc/os-release || lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install vagrant
```

Always ensure VirtualBox kernel modules are successfully compiled; otherwise Vagrant will fail to start the lab VM.

## Installing the labs

1. Install VirtualBox (from the Ubuntu repository or official site). You may need to restart your computer.
2. Install Vagrant (from repository or official `.deb`). You may need to restart your terminal.
3. Create an installation directory, for example for the ipv6 security lab:

```bash
mkdir -p ripencc/ipv6seclab
cd ripencc/ipv6seclab
```

4. Download the Vagrant configuration file:

```bash
vagrant init ripencc/ipv6seclab
```

You should see a message:

```bash
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
```

5. Start the lab environment:

```bash
$ vagrant up
```
Wait a few minutes while Vagrant downloads and starts the VM (approximately 2 GB). See the Troubleshooting section 
below for details if `vagrant up` fails.

    default: your host and reload your VM.
    default: 
    default: Guest Additions Version: 6.0.0 r127566
    default: VirtualBox Version: 7.2
```

In the above output, the lab VM is up and running. And there is a Guest Additions mismatch:

   * The VM has Guest Additions 6.0.0, but my host VirtualBox is 7.2.
   * Usually not a problem if you only access the lab via the browser.
   * Issues only appear if you try to use shared folders or clipboard integration.

Optional: Guest Additions upgrade: If you want full VirtualBox integration (shared folders, clipboard, etc.), you 
can update Guest Additions inside the VM. Vagrant usually handles this with the vagrant-vbguest plugin:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant reload
```

The lab is now fully operational.

6. Access the lab via your web browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

7. Shutting down / starting the VM

Inside the lab folder, in my case `~/Development/experimentation/ripencc/ipv6seclab`:

```bash
# Stop the VM safely
vagrant halt

# Start it again
vagrant up

# Check VM status
vagrant status
```

## Common issues

* Vagrant cannot start VM: Check that VirtualBox kernel modules are loaded (`lsmod | grep vbox` for VirtualBox).
* Outdated VirtualBox/Vagrant versions: Use official releases if repository versions fail.
* DNS or networking problems: Ensure no other VM manager (KVM, libvirt) is running that may block VirtualBox from grabbing VT-x/AMD-V. Use the toggle script if needed.

On Linux, VirtualBox requires kernel modules to interface with your CPU virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V) and manage virtual devices. If these modules are missing or not compiled correctly, Vagrant will fail to start the VM with errors like “kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)” or “VT-x is not available.”

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Check which VirtualBox modules are loaded

```bash
lsmod | grep vbox
```

You should see something like:

```
vboxdrv       45056  0
vboxnetflt    20480  0
vboxnetadp    20480  0
vboxpci       16384  0
```

If no `vbox*` modules appear, they are not loaded.

### 2. Rebuild VirtualBox kernel modules

Make sure you have the required packages installed:

```bash
sudo apt install dkms build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

Then force a rebuild:

```bash
sudo /sbin/vboxconfig
```

You should see output like:

```
Stopping VirtualBox kernel modules ...done.
Recompiling VirtualBox kernel modules ...done.
Starting VirtualBox kernel modules ...done.
```

If there are errors, carefully read the log — often it’s missing headers, `gcc` mismatch, or old kernel leftovers.

---

### 3. Load modules manually (if needed)

```bash
sudo modprobe vboxdrv
sudo modprobe vboxnetflt
sudo modprobe vboxnetadp
```

Verify again with `lsmod | grep vbox`.

---

### 4. Test Vagrant

After modules are loaded:

```bash
cd ~/ripencc/ipv6seclab
vagrant up
```

It should start the VM without kernel/VT-x errors.

---

Whenever you update your kernel, VirtualBox kernel modules often need to be rebuilt with `sudo /sbin/vboxconfig`. This is why having `dkms` installed is useful — it automatically recompiles the modules for new kernels.
