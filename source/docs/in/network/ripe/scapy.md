# Using Scapy in RIPE labs

Scapy is a packet manipulation tool and library. It lets you *build*, *send*, *receive*, and *decode* packets down to the protocol field level. Think of it as `ping` + `tcpdump` + `Wireshark` + a packet foundry — but interactive and scriptable.

## 1. Starting Scapy

```bash
scapy
```

If you see a `>>>` Python-like prompt, you’re in. Quit later with `exit()`, `quit()`, or `Ctrl+D`.

## 2. Building packets

In Scapy, packets are built layer by layer using `/` to stack protocols:

```python
pkt = IPv6(src="2001:db8:5::5", dst="ff02::1") / ICMPv6ND_NA()
```

* `IPv6(...)` → the IPv6 header

  * `src` = source IPv6 address
  * `dst` = destination IPv6 address (`ff02::1` = all nodes on the local link)

* `/ ICMPv6ND_NA()` → attach an ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement message on top.

At this point, you have an object called `pkt`. It’s not sent yet, just sitting in memory.

## 3. Sending packets

### 3.1 One-way send

```python
send(pkt)
```

This just fires it off — no listening for replies. Good for testing or attacks where you don’t care about responses.

## 4. Probing with Echo Requests

Let’s try an ICMPv6 ping:

```python
f = IPv6(dst="2001:db8:f:1::1") / ICMPv6EchoRequest()
```

* The `IPv6` layer sets the destination.
* The `ICMPv6EchoRequest()` layer is the IPv6 equivalent of `ping`.

### 4.1 Send and receive

```python
ans, unans = sr(f)
```

* `sr()` = send packet(s) and receive answers.
* `ans` = answered packets (pairs of request + reply).
* `unans` = unanswered packets (request sent, but no reply received).

## 5. Inspecting Results

```python
ans.summary()
```

This gives a one-line overview of request → reply mapping:

```
IPv6 / ICMPv6 Echo Request ==> IPv6 / ICMPv6 Echo Reply
```

For deep inspection:

```python
ans.show()
```

Which prints full decoded layers, e.g.:

```
0000 IPv6 / ICMPv6 Echo Request (id: 0x0 seq: 0x0) ==> 
     IPv6 / ICMPv6 Echo Reply (id: 0x0 seq: 0x0)
```

### 5.1 Accessing individual results

* First request/reply pair:

```python
ans[0]
```

Which is a tuple: `(<sent packet>, <received packet>)`

* Just the reply:

```python
ans[0][1]
```

* Just the request:

```python
ans[0][0]
```

* Show all fields of the request:

```python
ans[0][0].show()
```

Output example:

```text
###[ IPv6 ]###
  version= 6
  tc= 0
  fl= 0
  plen= None
  nh= ICMPv6
  hlim= 64
  src= 2001:db8:f:1:216:3eff:feee:a
  dst= 2001:db8:f:1::1
###[ ICMPv6 Echo Request ]###
  type= Echo Request
  code= 0
  cksum= None
  id= 0x0
  seq= 0x0
```

## 6. Repeated probing with `srloop`

```python
ans, unans = srloop(f)
```

This continuously sends requests until you break it (`Ctrl+C`).

Example output:

```
RECV 1: IPv6 / ICMPv6 Echo Reply (id: 0x0 seq: 0x0)
RECV 1: IPv6 / ICMPv6 Echo Reply (id: 0x0 seq: 0x0)
RECV 1: IPv6 / ICMPv6 Echo Reply (id: 0x0 seq: 0x0)
^C
Sent 3 packets, received 3 packets. 100.0% hits.
```

You can then summarise the results:

```python
ans.summary()
```

## 7. Capturing packets

To capture packets in Scapy, use the `sniff()` function. You need to pass the interface where you want to capture 
packets and define a filtering rule if you do not want to capture all of the packets arriving on that interface.

```python
>>> pkts=sniff(iface="eth0",lfilter = lambda x: x.haslayer(IPv6))
^C
```

## 8. Summary

* Packet composition: Use `/` to stack headers and protocols.
* Sending:

  * `send()` = fire and forget.
  * `sr()` = send and receive (store replies).
  * `srloop()` = send repeatedly until you stop it.
* Inspection:

  * `summary()` for one-liners.
  * `show()` for all fields.
  * Index into `ans` for detailed request/reply tuples.

Scapy does not validate whether fields are "legal" — if you want to set insane values (like Flow Label abuse for covert channels), Scapy will happily craft and send it.
