Wolverines do not ask for permissions
=======================================

The cloud is a frozen tundra - vast, unforgiving, and full of poorly-guarded caches of meat (data). The wolverine
doesn't "explore" cloud environments; it tears through them with claws of CLI commands and teeth of exploit scripts.
IAM roles? Chewed through. Storage buckets? Ripped open. Serverless functions? Crunched like frozen bones. From
AWS to Azure, we operate on one principle: If it's in the cloud, it's already ours - they just don't know it yet.
