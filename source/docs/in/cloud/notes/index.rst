Claw, bite, and retain access
==================================

Account and privilege attacks are the first bite to the throat - once we're in, we're staying in. Cloud-centric
attacks turn misconfigured services into our personal larders. Abusing misconfigurations is like sniffing out
frozen carcasses under the snow - the cloud is full of them if you know where to dig. Hacking CI/CD pipelines lets
us plant our claws deep in the infrastructure - because why hunt every day when you can poison the whole food chain?
