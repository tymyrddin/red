# Introduction

Infrastructure as Code transforms offensive operations by enabling version-controlled, reproducible environments that 
can be deployed globally within minutes. Automated provisioning pipelines ensure consistent configuration across all 
operational nodes while allowing rapid reconstruction of compromised elements. Terraform's declarative approach 
combined with provider-agnostic design patterns creates resilient infrastructure that can adapt to changing 
operational requirements and survive individual component failures without manual intervention.

* Maintenance takes little time, and we can focus on the pentesting/red teaming itself.
* Terraform is open source and [supports a number of cloud providers](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers), 
which makes it the best choice if you chose an alternative provider that accepts Zcash.

## How?
