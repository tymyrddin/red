The wind is automationâ€™s invisible hand
========================================

Terraform is what happens when sysadmins get tired of manually building servers and decide to automate themselves into
early retirement. It's like teaching a very literal genie to build your infrastructure - just be careful what you wish
for, because that "aws_instance.evil_c2" you just deployed might come with an unexpected "aws_bill.mortgage_refinance"
attached. The real magic happens when your infrastructure can burn itself down and rebuild faster than the blue team
can say "wait, how did they..."
