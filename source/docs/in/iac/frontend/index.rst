Serpent-woven HTTP
====================================

Frontends are the infosec version of those restaurants that are definitely not money laundering operations -
everything looks perfectly legitimate until you notice the weird traffic patterns at 3 AM. They'll happily serve up
cat memes and corporate blogs to casual visitors while quietly funneling reverse shells to your waiting C2 like a
very polite but extremely shady butler. The key is making sure your frontend's SSL certificate looks more legitimate
than the excuses you'll need when this all goes sideways.
