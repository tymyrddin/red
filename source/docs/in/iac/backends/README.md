# Introduction

Command and Control platform selection requires careful consideration of operational requirements versus detection 
risks. Mature frameworks offer reliability and feature completeness but often carry signature-based detection risks, 
while custom solutions provide stealth at the cost of development overhead. Containerised deployment patterns allow 
rapid iteration and testing of different C2 platforms while maintaining isolation between operational environments 
and enabling quick replacement of burned infrastructure.
