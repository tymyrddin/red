Backends’ sweet surrender
==========================================

Selecting a C2 framework is like swiping through infosec Tinder - do you go for the reliable but boring Metasploit,
the flashy-but-high-maintenance Cobalt Strike, or roll your own and spend the next six months debugging Python
imports? Each has its charms and its red flags, and just like dating, the wrong choice can leave you waking up to a
nasty surprise from your blue team "matches". The key is finding one that won't ghost you when you need it most or
leave obvious traces all over your target's network.
