The crown: Attack machines at the summit
=========================================

Your attack machine should be more paranoid than a conspiracy theorist with a new tin foil hat - VPNs within VPNs,
operating systems that forget everything on reboot, and a location that's either suspiciously precise ("an abandoned
missile silo in Nebraska") or suspiciously vague ("the cloud, probably"). Treat every login like you're being watched,
because let's face it - you probably are, and that "Microsoft Tech Support" popup might actually be some law
enforcement team this time.
