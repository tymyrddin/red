# Use an ephemeral OS

For red teaming, use an ephemeral operating system that flushes everything away on every reboot. Store this OS on a USB
stick, and whenever a nice spot is found, plug it into the computer and boot from it.

[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) is an excellent Linux distribution for this purpose. It automatically rotates the MAC 
address, forces all connections to go through Tor, and avoids storing data on the laptopâ€™s hard disk.
If you do wish to keep some data, make sure to encrypt that data and store it on portable storage.
