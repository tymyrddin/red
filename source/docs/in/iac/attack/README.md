# Introduction

Operational security demands hardened attack platforms that implement multiple layers of isolation and anonymization. 
Ephemeral operating systems running on sanitized hardware provide clean execution environments for each operation, 
while multi-hop VPN tunnels and geographic obfuscation frustrate attribution attempts. Strict compartmentalization 
ensures no single credential or device compromise can expose the full operational picture, with regularly rotated 
access tokens and burnable devices providing additional protection against persistent threats.

## How?

* [Choose carefully when using a VPN](vpn.md)
* [Pick a sound location to attack from](location.md)
* [Use an ephemeral OS](ephemeral.md)
* [Use an attack server](server.md)
