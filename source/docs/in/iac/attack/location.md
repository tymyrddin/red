# Pick a sound location

Whether using Tor or VPN services, always assume that your IP address, thus your geographical location and/or browser 
fingerprint is known to intermediaries and can be discovered by the target or anyone investigating on their behalf.

Use public gathering places (train stations, libraries) that have public Wi-Fi to quietly conduct operations. 
Just another dot in the big data stream. Not the same place. Visit new locations and even change city on occasion. 
Maybe even country.

War driving is an option in locations with many surveillance cameras. A typical Wi-Fi receiver of a free public 
hotspot (or one that is poorly secured, and you can break into) can catch a signal up to 40 meters away, which can be 
increased with a directional antenna.
