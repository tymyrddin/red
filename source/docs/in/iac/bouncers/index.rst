Bounce servers’ hidden rings
==========================================

Bounce servers are the cybersecurity equivalent of that one friend's couch you crash on when things get too hot -
temporary, deniable, and completely disposable. They're your operational base of... well, not exactly operations,
more like that shady storage unit where you keep all the tools you don't want traced back to your actual address.
Just remember to burn them down regularly, because nothing ruins a good opsec posture like a cloud provider's
forensic team finding your Terraform state files next to those "funny" log entries.
