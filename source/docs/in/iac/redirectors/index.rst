Redirectors’ tangled deception
==============================================

Redirectors are the three-card monte dealers of the infosec world - keeping the blue team's eyes focused on the
wrong hand while the real action happens elsewhere. They'll happily take the abuse of reputation blocks and
geo-filters so your precious C2 can keep sipping piña coladas on some offshore VPS. The best redirectors leave
investigators chasing ghosts through a hall of mirrors, wondering why their carefully blocked IPs keep getting
replaced faster than they can update their SIEM rules.
