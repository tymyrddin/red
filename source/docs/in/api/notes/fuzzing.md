# Fuzz deep and wide

To be able to craft requests to an API, and perhaps even already find some information disclosures, security 
misconfigurations, excessive data exposures, and logic flaws, fuzz all the things, including:

* Authentication, authorization & roles (privileges and permissions)
* Data input validation, handling & processing
* Encryption & sequencing
* Business logic, source code & parameter manipulation

Results in validation of vulnerabilities that can or may be exploited.
