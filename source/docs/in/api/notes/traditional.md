# Try traditional injections

Use API requests that are vulnerable to injection: Send input to be directly executed by the APIâ€™s supporting technologies (web application, database, or OS running on the server), bypassing input validation measures.

1. Discover requests that accept user input 
2. Test for XSS/XAS
3. Perform database-specific attacks or operating system injection
