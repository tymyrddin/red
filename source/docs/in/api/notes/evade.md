# Evasive techniques

To be able to trick the API when security controls are in place, such as a WAF that scans requests for common attacks, 
input validation that restricts the type of input, or a rate limit that restricts how many requests can be sent:

1. Add string terminators to attacks
2. Add case switching to attacks 
3. Encode payloads 
4. Combine different evasion techniques 
5. Rinse and repeat 
6. Apply evasive techniques to all attacks
