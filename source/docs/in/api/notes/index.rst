Tusks, snouts, and fuzzing snorts
==========================================

Rate limit tests are just the first charge: overwhelm the gates until they splinter. Collect request intel like a boar
tracks truffle-scent: headers, cookies, and misconfigured CORS are your aromatic gold. Fuzz deep and wide, because
brute force plus precision equals overturned endpoints. Attack authentication by shouldering through weak JWT fences.
Exploit authorisation like a boar in a vineyard: take what’s sweet, trample the rest.
