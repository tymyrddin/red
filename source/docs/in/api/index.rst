Where wild boars plough through endpoints
==========================================

APIs are the forest floor of the digital wild: rich with hidden truffles (data) and ripe for rooting. The wild boar
doesn’t request access; it digs, charges, and leaves overturned earth (broken auth) and trampled thickets (rate limits)
in its wake. REST, GraphQL, SOAP, it doesn’t matter. If there’s a payload to be shoved into a parameter or a weak JWT
to be cracked like an acorn underfoot, the boar will find it.
