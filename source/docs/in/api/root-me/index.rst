Where boars sharpen their tusks
=================================

Root-Me’s web challenges are the brambles where young boars train. GraphQL introspection is just the first berry
bush—shake it hard enough, and the queries fall like fruit. SSRF becomes a mud wallow to dirty internal systems.
IDOR? A fallen log begging to be rolled. Each challenge is a new patch of forest to dominate, whether by brute
force or sly rooting through layers of flawed logic.
